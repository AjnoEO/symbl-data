Hanunoo is a Unicode block containing characters used for writing the Hanunó'o language.

Hanunó’o is one of the indigenous scripts of the Philippines and is used by the Mangyan peoples of southern Mindoro to write the Hanunó'o language. It is an abugida descended from the [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmic] scripts, closely related to Baybayin, and is famous for being written vertical but written upward, rather than downward as nearly all other scripts (however, it's read horizontally left to right). It is usually written on bamboo by incising characters with a knife. Most known Hanunó'o inscriptions are relatively recent because of the perishable nature of bamboo. It is therefore difficult to trace the history of the script.
