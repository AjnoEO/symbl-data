The block contains rare and obsolete hieroglyphs of CJK (The Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts). Here you can see a lot of encoded variants of the characters registered in the Ideographic Variation Database of Unicode.

Seriously, I've never studied these languages, so colour me impressed. This number of symbols is enough to provide you with the necessary repertoire to speak to your ancestors via Ouija board! Be careful though, you don't wanna bring them back accidentally, so use these hieroglyphs wisely.
