Tangut hieroglyphs consist of various structural elements. The majority of them include from 8 to 15 outlines. In order to make the exploration of the Tangut script less complicated, Unicode has prepared the components which are used to make up hieroglyphs. So you have an opportunity to study them and become a hieroglyph expert. 

These Tangut components don't have any standard way of building up a hieroglyph. That's why the basis was compiled from the seventeen dictionaries in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and English.
