Meroitic Hieroglyphs is a Unicode block which can be characterized as a formal hieroglyphic. It presents various characters for writing Meroitic Egyptian. Here are the most important facts about this alphabet:

[*] The Meroitic script is basically an alphabet of 23 symbols used from the II century BC till the V century AC in Nubia and Northern Sudan. 
[*] It has two varieties: hieroglyphic (known from inscriptions on monuments, comes from [BLOCK:meroitic-hieroglyphs the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing]) and [BLOCK:meroitic-cursive cursive] (from demotic writing). 
[*] The hieroglyphic symbols were written in columns, from top to bottom, from right to left. The more common cursive form was written from right to left, from top to bottom.
[*] The alphabet was decoded at the beginning of the XX century by [i]Francis Llewellyn Griffith[/i]; however, most symbols and meanings still remain unclear
[*] 4 vowels + 14 consonants + 5 syllables
[*] Apparently, the Meroitic script was also utilized for writing the Old Nubian language (the ancestor of Meroitic written mostly in [BLOCK:coptic Coptic] or modified Greek)
