The Śāradā, or Sharada, script is an abugida writing system of the [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmic] family of scripts, developed around the 8th century. It was used for writing Sanskrit and Kashmiri. The [BLOCK:gurmukhi Gurmukhī] script was developed from Śāradā. Originally more widespread, its use became later restricted to Kashmir, and it is now rarely used except by the Kashmiri Pandit community for ceremonial purposes. Śāradā is another name for Saraswati, the goddess of learning.
