Glagolitic Supplement Symbols are a set of characters used to extend the Glagolitic alphabet, which was used to write Old Church Slavonic, the liturgical language of the Orthodox Slavic peoples. The Glagolitic script was developed in the 9th century by two Byzantine brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, who were sent by the Byzantine Emperor to evangelize the Slavic peoples. It is used along with [BLOCK:old-cyrillic Old Cyrillic].

The Glagolitic script was widely spread in Eastern Europe until the 16th century, when it was gradually replaced by the Cyrillic script. However, it continued to be used in some parts of Croatia and Slovenia for several more centuries.

The Glagolitic Supplement Symbols were added to the Unicode Standard in 2008 as part of the Unicode 5.1 release. They consist of 4 characters: two combining marks and two precomposed characters. The combining marks are used to indicate tone and stress in Old Church Slavonic text, while the precomposed characters are used to represent abbreviations for common words and phrases.

Despite the declining use of the Glagolitic script, there is still interest in its history and cultural significance. The Glagolitic Supplement Symbols help to preserve this important part of Slavic cultural heritage for future generations.
