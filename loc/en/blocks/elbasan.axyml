The Elbasan script is a mid 18th-century alphabetic script used for the Albanian language. It was named after the city of Elbasan where it was invented. It was mainly used in the area of Elbasan and Berat.
The primary document associated with the alphabet is the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript, known in Albanian as the Anonimi i Elbasanit (The Anonymous of Elbasan). The document was created at St. Jovan Vladimir's Church in central Albania, but is preserved today at the National Archives of Albania in Tirana. Its 59 pages contain Biblical content written in an alphabet of 40 letters.
Another original script used for Albanian, was Beitha Kukju's script of the 19th century. This script did not have much influence either.
