The block contains rare and obsolete hieroglyphs of CJK (The Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts). Here you can see a lot of encoded variants of the characters registered in the Ideographic Variation Database of Unicode.

CJK is already getting on my nerves, too many extensions for a person who doesn't speak Oriental languages. Call an ambulance! I can barely breathe.
