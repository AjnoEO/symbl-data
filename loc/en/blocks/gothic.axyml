The Gothic alphabet is an alphabet for writing the Gothic language, created in the 4th century by Ulfilas (or Wulfila) for the purpose of translating the Bible.
The alphabet is essentially an uncial form of the [BLOCK:greek-coptic Greek alphabet], with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology: Latin F, two Runic letters to distinguish the /j/ and /w/ glides from vocalic /i/ and /u/, and the letter Æ•air to express the Gothic labiovelar. It is completely different from the 'Gothic script' of the Middle Ages, a script used to write the [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin alphabet].
