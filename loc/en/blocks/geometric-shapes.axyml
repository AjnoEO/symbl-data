Geometric Shapes is a Unicode block that consists of 96 symbols referring to geometry at codepoint range U+25A0-25FF. Squares, triangles, rectangles, pointing left, right, up, down; transparent or painted shapes, striped or chequered â–¦. It's absolutely up to you in what contexts to apply them.

For example, some look like buttons on a keyboard [U:25AA] or road signs showing direction [U:25BB]. My favourite is this square [U:25AE], because it looks smooth and serene. Perfect for copying and pasting on social media!

Seriously speaking, geometric shapes come in handy if you specialise in [b]art, design, or engineering[/b]. They are basically figures which represent the forms of different life objects. Some figures are two-dimensional, whereas some are three-dimensional shapes. In our case, we're talking about two-dimensional, of course. Although, this quarter-eaten pie on a plate [U:25F4] seems pretty three-dimensional to me.
