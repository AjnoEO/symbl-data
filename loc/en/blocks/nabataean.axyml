The Nabataean alphabet is a consonantal alphabet (otherwise called abjad) that was used by the Nabataeans in the 2nd century BC. Its most significant inscriptions were found in Petra, Jordan. The alphabet descended from the [BLOCK:syriac Syriac alphabet], which developed from the [BLOCK:imperial-aramaic Aramaic alphabet]. Consequently, the cursive form of Nabataean grew into the [BLOCK:arabic Arabic alphabet] in the 4th century, which is why the Nabataean's letterforms seem like a mixture between the more northerly Semitic scripts (such as the Aramaic-derived [BLOCK:hebrew]) and those of [BLOCK:arabic Arabic].
