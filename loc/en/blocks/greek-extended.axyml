Greek Extended is a Unicode block containing the accented vowels necessary for writing polytonic Greek. The regular, unaccented Greek characters can be found in the [BLOCK:greek-coptic Greek and Coptic] (Unicode block). Greek Extended was encoded in version 1.1 of the Unicode Standard as is, having had no additions up to 6.2. As an alternative to Greek Extended, combining characters can be used to represent the tones and breath marks of polytonic Greek.
