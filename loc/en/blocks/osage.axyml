This alphabet represents the Osage language which was spoken by Osage indians. They used to live in the north of Oklahoma (US). This language is included in the Red Book of Endangered Languages (UNESCO). Today it's a dead language — the last native speaker passed away in 2005. Nevertheless, in 2006 Herman Mongrain Lookout created a script for Osage. In 2014 he improved it significantly, and in 2016 it was added to Unicode. 

Оsage design is based on the Latin alphabet. Words are written from left to right. It uses common European diacritics, punctuation, and numbers.
