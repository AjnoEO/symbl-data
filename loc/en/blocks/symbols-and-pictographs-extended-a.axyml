This block is an extension for [block:supplemental-symbols-and-pictographs Supplemental-symbols-and-pictographs]. You can actually use these symbols as [URL /en/emoji/ emojis]. The types include clothes, medecine, food, people, and my favourite "other objects" section, where you can find such useful things, as a bucket ðŸª£, a tooth brush ðŸª¥, even a tombstone ðŸª¦.

Honestly, I think these emojis are met less often than the classic cat faces. So copy them asap!
