The Duployan shorthand, or Duployan stenography (French: Sténographie Duployé), was created by father Émile Duployé(fr) in 1860 for writing French. The system got widespread thanks to the Institut Sténographique Des Deux Mondes in Paris. In addition, Duployé was the one who started the overall "Bibliothèque Sténographique" published by this Institute.

Since then, it has been expanded and adapted for writing English, German, Spanish, Romanian, and Chinook Jargon. In France itself, up to thirty newspapers in publication use the Duployan system. 

The Duployan stenography is classified as a geometric, alphabetic, stenography and is written left-to-right in connected stenographic style. The Duployan shorthands, including Chinook writing, Pernin's Universal Phonography, Perrault's English Shorthand, the Sloan-Duployan Modern Shorthand, and Romanian stenography, were included as a single script in version 7.0 of the Unicode Standard / ISO 10646.
