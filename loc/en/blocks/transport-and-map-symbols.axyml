Transport and Map Symbols is a Unicode block containing transportation and map icons, largely for compatibility with Japanese Telephone carriers' [BLOCK:emoticons-(emoji) emoji] implementations of Shift JIS and to encode characters in the Wingdings and Wingdings 2 character sets.

The section includes vehicles, road signs, residential premises and topographic conventional signs necessary for navigation.

These symbols can be used to indicate various objects and elements on maps and plans, available routes in a particular region and landscape features of the area. In addition, the symbols from this block can be used to decorate any text or post about tourism or construction.
