Georgian Supplement is a Unicode block containing characters for the ecclesiastical form of the Georgian script, Nuskhuri. To write the full ecclesiastical Khutsuri orthography, use the Asomtavruli capitals encoded in the [BLOCK:georgian] block.

It's important to mention that Georgian is an alphabetic script, applied in several Kartvelian languages. First of all, it's Georgian itself, plus, [b]sometimes Megrelian, Svan[/b] and other. It's read from left to right. The modern Georgian alphabet consists of 33 letters; it doesn't possess any capital letters, but in some situations (when there's a title, for example), the whole word may be written without upper or lower change in position, as if between two parallel lines. Such type of writing serves as an analogue to the little letters in other alphabets.

In 1938—1954 the Georgian alphabet adopted more symbols and started to be used for Abkhaz and Ossetian (in South Ossetia) languages.
