Additional small letters for Japanese syllabic alphabets [block:hiragana Hiragana] and [block:katakana Katakana]. These letters are obsolete â€” they are not used anymore. Most of them were found in various manuscripts and documents about the phonetic transcription of non-Japanese terms in musical notes. Plus, the names of various objects on maps.

So far only the letters approved and confirmed by linguists have been encoded. But there is a lot of space for additional symbols, as scholars will continue to explore them.
