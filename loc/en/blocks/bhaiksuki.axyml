Bhaiksuki is a historical alphabet used in the 11th and 12th centuries AD in India. It was spread on the territories where the modern states of Bihar and Bengal are situated. The Bhaiksuki script was used to write in the Sanskrit language. Later on, the scholars found 11 short inscriptions on objects and 4 manuscripts in this script. All of them represent Buddhist religious texts.

In English-speaking countries, Bhaiksuki is also known as Arrow-Headed translation. It's derived from Brahmi. The most similar are [block:devanagari Devanagari] and [block:sharada Sharada]. 

The Bhaiksuki alphabet is syllabic, it's an abugida. It uses a virama. The writing goes from left to right. The words are separated by the following symbol: [U:11C43].

In addition, this script has two sets of digits. The first one is for the decimal positional system. Moreover, the outlines of the digits 0 and 3 are unknown — they are taken from similar scripts. The second is designed for a non—positional system, which contains ones, tens and a sign for multiplication by 100.
