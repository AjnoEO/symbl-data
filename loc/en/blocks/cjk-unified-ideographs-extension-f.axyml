The block contains rare and obsolete hieroglyphs of CJK (The Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts). Here you can see a lot of encoded variants of the characters registered in the Ideographic Variation Database of Unicode.

However, for me this block is nothing else but another set of white squares, supposedly hiding some mysterious signs I'll never be able to learn. If you have the same problem, go to the [URL /en/blocks/cjk-unified-ideographs-extension-b/ CJK B extension] and enjoy the full-sized hieroglyphs in their natural habitat. Maybe you'll want to study Oriental languages. I'm done.

If you haven't checked the previous A-E CJK extensions, you're missing the whole fun. I've been whining for a while now.
