Sorang Sompeng script is used to write in Sora, a Munda language with 300,000 speakers in India. The script was created by Mangei Gomango in 1936 and is used in religious contexts. He was familiar with [BLOCK:oriya], [BLOCK:telugu] and English, so the parent systems of the script are [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmi] and [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin].
