The Wancho script was designed by a public school teacher Banwang Losu from 2001 till 2012. The purpose was to make writing the Wancho language possible. Nowadays it's spoken by more than 50 000 people in Longding district, Arunachal Pradesh (Indian north-east). Nowadays this alphabet and script is taught at local schools.

Wancho represents quite an ordinary alphabet, which is pretty customary for many cultures, as it consists of consonants and vowels. The direction of the writing is from left to right. The diacritical signs above the vowels signify tones. The alphabet uses standard European punctuation.

The last symbol in the block Wancho Ngun stands for the Indian currency rupee.
