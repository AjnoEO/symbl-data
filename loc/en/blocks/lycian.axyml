The Lycian alphabet was used to write the Lycian language on the final stage of its existence. It was an extension of the [BLOCK:greek-coptic Greek alphabet], with half a dozen new additional letters for sounds. However, it didn't stem from Greek directly, but rather from the Phoenician alphabet. It was largely similar to the [BLOCK:lydian Lydian] and the Phrygian alphabets. 

That's why the external similarity with the Greek alphabet is misleading: a number of letters similar in shape have completely different meanings. Although the Lycian script is basically alphabetic, there are some remnants of the consonantism of the Phoenician alphabet from which it originated (for example, one symbol for a consonant can mean a syllable).
