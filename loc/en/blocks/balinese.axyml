Balinese is a Unicode block containing characters for the basa Bali language.

The Balinese script, natively known as Aksara Bali and Hanacaraka, is an abugida used in the island of Bali, Indonesia, commonly for writing the Austronesian Balinese language, Old Javanese, and the liturgical language Sanskrit. With some modifications, the script is also used to write the Sasak language, used in the neighboring island of Lombok. The script is a descendant of the [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmi script], and so has many similarities with the modern scripts of South and Southeast Asia. The Balinese script, along with the [BLOCK:javanese-alphabet Javanese script], is considered the most elaborate and ornate among Brahmic scripts of Southeast Asia.
Though everyday use of the script has largely been supplanted by the [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin alphabet], the Balinese script has significant prevalence in many of the island's traditional ceremonies and is strongly associated with the Hindu religion. The script is mainly used today for copying lontar or palm leaf manuscripts containing religious texts.
