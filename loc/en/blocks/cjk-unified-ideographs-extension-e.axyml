The block contains rare and obsolete hieroglyphs of CJK (The Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts). Here you can see a lot of encoded variants of the characters registered in the Ideographic Variation Database of Unicode.

I definitely adore this CJK extension. The majority of the hieroglyphs is not available on my laptop, so there's just a bunch of squares dangling on my screen, like pears or apples on a tree in Minecraft. Plus, as I mentioned in other CJK descriptions, I'm not a fan of Oriental languages. I would rather savour the identical geometrical shapes with question marks.
