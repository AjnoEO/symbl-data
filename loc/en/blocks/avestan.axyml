The Avestan alphabet is a writing system developed during Iran's Sassanid era (AD 226â€“651) to render the Avestan language.
 
As a side effect of its development, the script was also used for Pazend, a method of writing Middle Persian that was used primarily for the Zend commentaries on the texts of the Avesta. In the texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the alphabet is referred to as din dabireh or din dabiri, Middle Persian for "the religion's script".
