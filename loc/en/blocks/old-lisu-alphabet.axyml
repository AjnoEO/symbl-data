The Fraser script or Lisu script is an alphabet created in 1915 by a missionary protestant James Fraser for the Lisu language. Currently, the Fraser script is the official font for the Lisu living in China.

The script is based on the capital letters of the Latin alphabet. Apart from that, you can find the following signs: uppercase Latin letters inverted from top to bottom or from left to right. Tones are indicated by European punctuation marks.
