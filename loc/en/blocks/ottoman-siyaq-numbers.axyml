Siyaq is the name of the decimal positional number system, which is common in Central and South Asia. The main feature of this system is that it has separate symbols for ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands. Plus, you won't find a "zero" number. 

What comes to semantics, the word "siyak" itself means order in the Arabic language.

The characters of the numbers are based on Arabic letters, which the names of the numbers started with. The writing was directed from right to left.
