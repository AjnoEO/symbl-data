The block contains rare and obsolete hieroglyphs of CJK (The Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts). Here you can see a lot of encoded variants of the characters registered in the Ideographic Variation Database of Unicode.

Finally, the last CJK extension! You're truly lucky if you didn't have to go through the previous ones. I had. That's why I'm barely alive. But I made it to the last extension, and I feel inspired as never. 

So don't shy away from doing the same, and check the whole list of CJK extensions from A to G. You only live once!
