The Ahom script was used by Thais who migrated in the 13th century to the valley of the Brahmaputra River (Indian state of Assam). Archaeologists had found many inscriptions on coins, stone walls, trees, metal plates. The oldest Ahom inscription dates back to the 15th century. In the 17th century, the language was replaced with Assamese, and it started to be written with the help of the [block:bengali Bengali script]. In an attempt to revive the language, an Ahom-Assamese-English dictionary was published in 1920. 

Nowadays you can find a lot of Ahom books, but its tonal system has been completely lost.

The Ahom script is considered the Brahmi's descendant. It is an abugida, all syllables of which end with a long "a". There are no independent vowels â€” they can be written as dependent together with the following symbol: [U:11712]. In the modern version of the script, the sign "killer" (virama) is used to eliminate the unnecessary vowels [U:1172B]. Apart from that, decimal digits have been added to the writing. Their outlines have no historical explanation.
