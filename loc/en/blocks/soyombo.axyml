The Mongolian scholar Zanabazar was an outstanding figure for his times. After having invented square writing, he developed a new kind of script called Soyombo. The Soyombo script was designed for the Mongolian and Tibetan languages, as well as for Sanskrit. The evidence of it can be found in the Buddhist handwritten texts.

Soembo is an abugida. The sound /a/ is added to the consonant by default. The direction of writing is horizontal, from left to right.

Apart from that, Zanabazar included a sign, which is now the main national symbol of Mongolia. It's called Soyombo (yes, the same as the script), and it looks like this: [U:11A9E]. It can be seen on the national flag, military stripes, national currency notes â€” tugriks.
