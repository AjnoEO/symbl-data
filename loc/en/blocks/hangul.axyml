Hangul is a phonemic script of the Korean language. Hangul's main characteristic feature is that the letters are united into groups according to syllables. This type of writing was developed in the middle of the XV century. Nowadays it's the main script of South Korea and the only one used in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
