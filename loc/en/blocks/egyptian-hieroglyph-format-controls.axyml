Egyptian ideograms may have more than one element. The section [block:egyptian-hieroglyphs Egyptian-hieroglyphs] presents glyphs separately. In order to make a full ideogram, you can use editing symbols from this block. They define the way in which elements are located towards each other in a square. For example, in order to create a cowboy, let's take a man's figure [U:13002], add a horse [U:130D7] down via U+13430, and spruce it up with feathers [U:13183] above to the right via U+13434. Segment restrictions allow to unite elements in groups and put them together.
