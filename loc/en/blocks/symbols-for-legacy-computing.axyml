The symbols which represent the legacy of computing technology were used in the old computer systems developed from the mid-70s to the mid-80s. This block includes icons for the teletext and mini-pixel formats, as well as the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, MAX and other.

Most of the symbols in this section are separate blocks, which served for making texts, images and other graphics.
