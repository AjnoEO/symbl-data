Multani is also known as Saraiki and Karikki language. It's one more ancestor of the Brahmic script. It was in use from the 18th century till the 20th century on the north-west of India and on the east of Pakistan for writing in the Saraiki language. It's one of the four alphabets formalised for writing along with [block:khudawadi Khudawadi], [block:khojki Khojki] and [block:gurmukhi Gurmukhi]. Now Multani is not as handy as it was before â€” Siraiki mostly uses Arabic letters. That's why glyphs are not standardized and must be processed at the font level. The samples presented in this section are taken from the printed version of the New Testament (the 1819 edition) and some other handwritten sources.
