The Old Slavic alphabet is the first Cyrillic alphabet of 46 letters. It was created presumably in the IX century for writing in the Old Slavic language. The same way its abc book was introduced too. 

The Cyrillic script goes back to the Greek charter script, with the addition of letters to convey sounds that were absent in the Greek language. Since its creation, the Cyrillic script has adapted to language changes. As a result of numerous reforms, it has acquired its own differences in each language. Different versions of the Cyrillic script can be found in Eastern Europe, as well as Central and Northern Asia. As an official script, it was first adopted in the First Bulgarian Kingdom.
