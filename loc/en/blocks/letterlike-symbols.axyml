Letterlike Symbols is a Unicode block containing 80 characters which are mostly built of the glyphs of one or more letters. In addition to this block, Unicode includes stylized [BLOCK:mathematical-alphanumeric-symbols mathematical alphabets], although Unicode does not really categorise these characters as being "letterlike".

Most of the symbols are perfect for decorating texts, posts, and making your nicknames or bio on various websites stand out.
