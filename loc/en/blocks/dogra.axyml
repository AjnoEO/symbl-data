The Dogra script is used for writing in the language of an ethnic group named Dogra. This Indo-Aryan language is spoken in the north of India, particularly on the territories of Jammu and Kashmir.

Dogra was standardised in 1860. Before that another alphabet was in use. It was called [block:takri Takri] and it resembled Dogra a lot. Nowadays the most popular script is [block:devanagari Devanagari], however Dogra is still applied. You can see the traces of it in typography and documents. Plus, the bank notes have an alphabet called "New Dogra Script" ("Name Dogra Akkar"). Thus, unofficial inscriptions are made with the old Dogra. As for Unicode, it displays the new font. 

This script is a descendant of Brahmi, and it's also abugida. A syllable contains one vowel by default. In order to delete it, you can use a virama. The writing goes from left to right.

Punctuation includes an abbreviation character and some characters used for ending sentences and paragraphs â€” danda and double danda. The numbers are not encoded at all, since the old ones are similar to the Takri numbers, and the new ones are similar to Devanagari.
