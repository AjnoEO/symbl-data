Arrows is a Unicode block containing lines, curves, and semicircle symbols terminating in barbs or arrows. It´s interesting that even arrows have categories: Unicode divides them into two groups in particular: simple arrows and arrows with modifications, not to mention the arrows with bent tips. Some arrows feel lonely when they travel alone, so they go in pairs. 

The general objectives of arrows (both in real life and Unicode) are to mark directions, connections, relations, logical assumptions, implications, and computer buttons. The main directions include the key four: up, down, left, right. However, some signs are coded in eight variants.
