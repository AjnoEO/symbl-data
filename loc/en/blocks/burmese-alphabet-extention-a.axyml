Burmese script is the written form of the Burmese language. It can be characterized as a kind of Indian consonant-syllabic script (abugida). It is used in Burma to write in Burmese, Mon (Mon script), Shan (Shan script) and several Karen languages. The characteristic feature of Burmese lies in its round forms. It can be explained through the fact that the traditional palm leaves used for writing were torn from straight lines, and therefore served as shape-forming materials. 

The writing goes from left to right. There are no omissions between words, although informal writing contains spaces between sentences.

Burmese script, originating from the Mon script, has undergone significant changes to accommodate Burmese phonology and SVO word order. The font changes depending on the language (Shan, Mon, etc.)
