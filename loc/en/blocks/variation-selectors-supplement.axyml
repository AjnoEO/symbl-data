Variation Selectors Supplement is a Unicode block that contains characters that are used to indicate a variation or modification of an existing character or symbol. This block is an addition to [block:variation-selectors Variation selectors]. These symbols may also represent specialized variants of a character that are used in particular contexts, such as in calligraphy or typography.

For example, the character "👩‍❤️‍👨" (couple with heart) can be modified using a variation selector to display different skin tones, hair colors, or other characteristics, such as gender or age. Similarly, a variation selector can be used to represent a particular style of a Chinese character that is used in calligraphy or art.
