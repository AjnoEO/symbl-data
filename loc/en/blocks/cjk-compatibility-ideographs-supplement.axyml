CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement is a Unicode block that contains a collection of characters that are primarily used for compatibility with older Chinese, Japanese, and Korean character sets. These characters are not commonly used in modern written communication, but they may be necessary for the proper display of historical documents or for certain specialized purposes, such as in the fields of calligraphy or art.

The characters in this block include various symbols, numerals, and ideographs that were used in traditional East Asian writing systems, but are no longer commonly used in modern communication. For example, there are characters for counting rods, astrological symbols, and various historical Chinese characters that are not included in the modern simplified or traditional Chinese character sets.

Overall, the CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement block is primarily used for historical and cultural purposes rather than everyday communication.
