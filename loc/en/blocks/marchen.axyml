Up to the 10th century the people of the northern Tibeth spoke Zhang-Zhung, a language which was quite popular at the time. To write in it, 5 scripts were invented. One of them was called Marchen. The Marchen script wasn't widespread â€” only a few samples were discovered. However, even today this script can be seen in calligraphy manuals and religious texts of Bon (a religion similar to Buddhism).

The Marchen script belongs to the Brahmi family. It's also an abugida, which is written from left to right. At the same time, it is similar to [block:tibetan Tibetan]. Two basic consonant signs can be written vertically, and a vowel is then put next to this column.
