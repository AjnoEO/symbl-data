The Newar alphabet was actively used in central Nepal since the 10th century BC. The proof of that is that scientists had found various samples of coins and manuscripts. In 1905 this script was banned, and in 1951 it was allowed again. Now it's used for writing in the Bahasa language, which, although endangered, is still native to 800 thousand people, mainly in the Kathmandu Valley.

The Newar script belongs to the Brahmi family. This is an abugida using virama too. Words are written from left to right. This section also contains characters needed only for writing Sanskrit.
