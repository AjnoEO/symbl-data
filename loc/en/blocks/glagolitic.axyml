Glagolitic is a Unicode block containing the characters invented by Saint Cyril for translating scripture into Slavonic. The Glagolitic script is the precursor of [BLOCK:cyrillic]. The Glagolitic alphabet /ˌɡlæɡɵˈlɪtɨk/, also known as Glagolitsa, is the oldest known Slavic alphabet, from the 9th century.

Glagolitic is one of the Slavic alphabets. It's believed that Glagolitic was created by the Slavic enlightener and philosopher Saint Cyril for writing church texts in the Old Church Slavonic language. The literary work about Cyril's life emphasizes that the Slavic alphabet was essential for conveying God's service. Therefore, all church books were also translated into Old Church Slavonic.

A lot of factors and evidence suggest that the Glagolitic alphabet was created much before the [BLOCK:cyrillic Cyrillic]. Consequently, Cyrillic was based on the Glagolitic and the [BLOCK:greek-coptic Greek alphabet]. The oldest inscription, which was made in a Bulgarian church and survived throughout times, refers exactly to 893. In addition, the oldest manuscripts, dated back to the X century, were written in a more archaic language, which was phonetically close to the language of the Southern Slavs.
