Mahjong (also spelled [i]majiang[/i], [i]mah jongg[/i], and numerous other variants), is a game that originated in China. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in South Korea and Japan). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have a small following in Western countries. Similar to the Western card game rummy, mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.

Each symbol usually depicts objects from Chinese culture and history, such as flowers, dragons, birds, pandas, etc. In total, there are 144 symbols in the Mahjong game, which are divided into several categories, including "Circles", "Bamboos", "Symbols of the season" and "Symbols of flowers". The categories contain 36 symbols numbered from 1 to 9. Each symbol has its own unique design and is used in the game to build certain combinations and sequences.
