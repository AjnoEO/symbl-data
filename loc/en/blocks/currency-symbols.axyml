This is a Unicode block containing characters for representing unique monetary signs or currencies. Many currency signs can be found in other Unicode blocks, especially if a [b][URL /en/collections/currency-symbols/ currency symbol][/b] is not unique for a particular country.

The currency signs (or [SET:currency-symbols currency symbols]) are, first of all, [b]independent graphemes[/b], which appeared a long time ago and were built on the basis of separate [BLOCK:cyrillic cyrillic] letters or [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin letters]. Some of them were introduced in the XVII—XVIII centuries as a result of script evolution, since various currency names were shortened to simple marks and symbols. A great example is, for instance, the symbols oa dollar $ and pound £, plus the symbol of rouble, dating back to the XVII—XIX centuries. Another group of symbols was born at the end of the XX century - the beginning of the XXI century. The reason for that was the decision made by the government and authorities that ruled during that time. Such marks include euro €, Armenian dram ֏, Indian rupee ₹.
