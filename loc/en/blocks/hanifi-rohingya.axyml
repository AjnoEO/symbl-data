Hanifi is the alphabet for the language of the Rohingya people living in Myanmar and Bangladesh. The total number of native speakers is about 1 million people. The original script was developed in the 1980s by the language committee under the leadership of Nolan Mohammad Hanif. Before that, the Rohingya people used Arabic. Nowadays Hanifi is used both in digital and handwritten texts.

The Hanifi letters are similar to Arabic. The text goes from right to left. At the same time, the alphabet is characterized as constant-vocal. Independent vowels are marked by the letter "A". You can add another vowel icon, if necessary. European and Arabic punctuation marks are used. Harifi has its own glyphs for decimal digits.
