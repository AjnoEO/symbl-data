Ancient North Arabian is a language known from fragmentary inscriptions in modern-day Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, dating to between roughly the 8th century BC and the 6th century AD, all written in scripts derived from Epigraphic [BLOCK:old-south-arabian South Arabian]. Pre-classical Arabic (or Old Arabic), the predecessor of Classical [BLOCK:arabic Arabic], seems to have coexisted with these languages in central and north Arabia. However, Arabic remained exclusively a spoken language until it was first attested in an inscription in Qaryat al-Faw (formerly Qaryat Dhat Kahil, near Sulayyil, Saudi Arabia) in the 1st century BC.
