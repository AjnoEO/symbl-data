The Takri script (sometimes called Tankri) is an abugida writing system of the [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmic] family of scripts. It is closely related to, and derived from, the [BLOCK:sharada] script employed by Kashmiri. It is also related to the [BLOCK:gurmukhi GurmukhÄ« script] used to write Punjabi. Until the late 1940s, Takri was the official script for writing the Dogri language in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.There are some record of using Takri script in the history of Nepali(Khas Kura),Takri has historically been used by a number of Western Pahari, Garhwali and Dardic languages in the Western Himalayas, such as Gaddi or Gaddki (the language of the Gaddi ethnic group), Kashtwari (the dialect centered on the Kashtwar or Kishtwar region of Jammu and Kashmir) and Chamiyali (the language of the Chamba region of Himachal Pradesh). Takri used to be most prevalent script for business records and communication in various parts of Himachal Pradesh including Chintpurni, Una, Kangra, Bilaspur, and Hamirpur regions. The aged businessmen can still be found using Takri in these areas, but newer generation has now shifted to [BLOCK:devanagari Devanagari] and even English (Roman). This shift can be traced to have happened during the period ranging from 1950s to 1980s.
