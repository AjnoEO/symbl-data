The Nandinagari script is an Indian abugida, a descendant of Brahmi. It has been known since the 7th century. The script was spread in the Deccan Plateau region in central India and in the south of the Hindustan Peninsula. From the 11th to the 19th it was used in the state of Maharashtra for writing in Sanskrit, and in Karnataka for writing in Kannada. It was the official language of the Vijayanagar Empire, which existed in southern India from 1336 to 1646. Nowadays it's no longer in use..

Nandinagari has all the features typical for Brahmic scripts and it is very similar to the[BLOCK:devanagari Devanagari script]. The outlines and meanings of the letters are similar. In addition, there is a horizontal line above the words. But for some differences in the systems, Nandinagari could be perceived as a variation of Devanagari.
