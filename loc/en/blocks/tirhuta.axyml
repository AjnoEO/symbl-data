Tirhuta or Mithilakshar is the script used for the Maithili language originated in Present-day Janakpur in Mithila region of Nepal and the oldest reference to Tirhuta Script is in Janaki Mandir of Janakpur where Rama and Sita wed. The script has a rich history spanning a thousand years, but years of neglect by Nepal and the Bihar government have taken their toll on the use of Tirhuta. Most speakers of Maithili have switched to using the Devanagari script, which is also used to write neighboring Central Indic languages such as Nepali and Hindi. As a result, the number of people with a working knowledge of Tirhuta has dropped considerably in recent years.
