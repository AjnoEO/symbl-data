Tifinagh is a Unicode block containing characters of the Tifinagh alphabet, used for writing Tuareg, Berber, and other languages of North Africa.

Tifinagh (Berber pronunciation: [tifinaɣ]; also written Tifinaɣ in the Berber [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin alphabet], ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ in Neo-Tifinagh, and تيفيناغ in the Berber [BLOCK:arabic Arabic alphabet]) is a series of abjad and alphabetic scripts used to write Berber languages.
A modern derivate of the traditional script, known as Neo-Tifinagh, was introduced in the 20th century. A slightly modified version of the traditional script, called Tifinagh Ircam, is used in a number of Moroccan elementary schools in teaching the Berber language to children as well as a number of publications.
The word tifinagh is thought to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate of Punic, through the Berber feminine prefix ti- and Latin Punicus; thus tifinagh could possibly mean "the [BLOCK:phoenician Phoenician] (letters)" or "the Punic letters".
