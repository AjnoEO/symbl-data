The Bassa script, known as Bassa vah or simply vah ('throwing a sign' in Bassa) was an alphabet designed by, or with the help of, Liberian missionaries in the 1920s. It is not clear what connection it may have had with neighboring scripts, or how much it was actually used, but type was cast for it, and an association for its promotion was formed in Liberia in 1959. It is not used and has been classified as a failed script.
Vah is a true alphabet, with 23 consonant letters, 7 vowel letters, and 5 tone diacritics, which are placed inside the vowels.
