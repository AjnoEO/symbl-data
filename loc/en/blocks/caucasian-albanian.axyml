The Caucasian Albanian alphabet was an alphabet used by the Caucasian Albanians. They were one of the ancient and indigenous Northeast Caucasian peoples, whose territory comprised parts of present-day Azerbaijan and Daghestan. 

[b]A bit of linguistic insights[/b]. Caucasian Albanian was one of the two indigenous alphabets ever developed for the speakers of the indigenous Caucasian languages (i.e. Caucasian languages that are not a part of larger groups like the Turkic and Indo-European families). The other alphabet is [BLOCK:georgian Georgian]. 

The [BLOCK:armenian Armenian language], the third indigenous language of Caucasus with its own alphabet, is an independent branch of the Indo-European language family, so it doesn't really count.
