New Tai Lue is a Unicode block containing characters for writing the Tai Lü language.

New Tai Lue script, also known as Simplified Tai Lue, is an alphabet used to write the Tai Lü language. Developed in China in the 1950s, New Tai Lue is based on the traditional [BLOCK:tai-le Tai Le alphabet] developed ca. 1200 AD. The government of China promoted the alphabet for use as a replacement for the older script; teaching the script was not mandatory, however, and as a result many are illiterate in New Thai Lue. In addition, communities in Burma, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam still use the [BLOCK:tai-le Tai Le alphabet].
