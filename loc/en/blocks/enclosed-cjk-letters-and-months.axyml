Enclosed CJK Letters and Months is a Unicode block containing circled and parenthesized [BLOCK:katakana Katakana], [BLOCK:hangul-syllables Hangul], and [BLOCK:cjk-unified-ideographs CJK ideographs]. During the unification with ISO 10646 for version 1.1, the Japanese Industrial Standard Symbol was reassigned from the code point U+32FF at the end of the block to U+3004. Also included in the block are miscellaneous glyphs that would more likely fit in [BLOCK:cjk-compatibility CJK Compatibility] or [BLOCK:enclosed-alphanumerics Enclosed Alphanumerics]: a few unit abbreviations, circled numbers from 21 to 50, and circled multiples of 10 from 10 to 80 enclosed in black squares (representing speed limit signs).
