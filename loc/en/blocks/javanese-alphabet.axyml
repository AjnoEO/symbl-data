The Javanese script, natively known as Aksara Jawa and Hanacaraka, is an abugida developed by the Javanese people to write several languages spoken in Indonesia, primarily the Austronesian Javanese language, an early form of Javanese called Kawi, as well as the liturgical language Sanskrit. The script is a descendant of the [BLOCK:brahmi Brahmi script], and so has many similarities with the modern scripts of South and Southeast Asia. The Javanese script, along with the Balinese script, is considered the most elaborate and ornate among Brahmic scripts of Southeast Asia.
The script was widely used by the court scribes of Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Numerous efforts to standardize the script were made in the late 19th to early 20th-century, with the invention of the script's first metal type and the development of concise orthographic guidelines. However, further development was halted abruptly during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in which its use was prohibited, and the script's use has since declined. Today, everyday use of the Javanese script has been largely supplanted by the [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin alphabet].
