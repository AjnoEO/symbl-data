Block Elements is a Unicode block containing square block symbols of various fill and shading.

Some of them look like parts of Minecraft's mobs and locations. Others remind me of Tetris - that long-forgotten block-based game, where you have to arrange  multiple pieces in a proper construction, while they're falling down from above in a random order.  

What can we do with these symbols? Well, first of all, use them for sending creepy messages. Let me show you:

▛▖ ▗▜
  ▙
 ▞▚   [i]we're not friends anymore[/i]
