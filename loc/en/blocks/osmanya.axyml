The Osmanya alphabet (Somali: Cismaanya, Osmanya: 𐒋𐒘𐒈𐒑𐒛𐒒𐒕𐒀), also known as Far Soomaali ("Somali writing"), is a writing script created to transcribe the Somali language. 

Here are some enjoyable facts about the language that we associate with pirates:

[*] It was invented between 1920 and 1922 by Osman Yusuf Kenadid of the Majeerteen Darod clan, the nephew of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo;
[*] The writing was pretty popular and in 1961 it was announced official along with [BLOCK:basic-latin Latin];
[*] However, after the military changes it was forbidden;
[*] Currently there is no confirmed data regarding this alphabet, due to the unstable situation in the country.

Anyways, you may use these symbols for texting or posting. For example, we decided to write the name of our website, and it looks like this: [b]𐒖𐒋𐒄𐒈𐒥[/b]. The last letter [U:104A5] actually looks like a pirate's hook.
