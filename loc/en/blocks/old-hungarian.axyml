Hungarian runes were used by Hungarians fot writing in their language before the Latin alphabet had been introduced in the 11th century. The earliest inscriptions date back to the 9th century. In some regions the runes managed to survive up to the 19th century, and they are still used nowadays as decorations. These runes are not related to [block:runic Germanic], they derived from earlier Hungarian runes, which, in turn, came from [block:old-turkic Old Turkic].

The Old Hungarian runic alphabet consists of 42 letters. The vowels are clearly distinguished, but they were not used in writing unless it was the end of a word. In other spots they were omitted, like, for example, in Arabic.

Apart from that, several digits are encoded in the end positions of the block. The number system is similar to the Roman one.
