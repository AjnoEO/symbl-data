The north of Iraq is inhabited by Yezidi people - a sub-ethic group of Kurds. That's where two religious manuscripts were found. There are two theories regarding their origin. Different scholars suggest that they belong to the 11th, 12, 13th, 17th century. Some believe that they are fakes created in the 19th century. Nevertheless, in 2013 Yezidi priests located in Georgia began to revive the writing of Yezidi manuscripts. Several letters were added and removed, all ligatures were excluded. Nowadays the script is used in the Yezidi temple in Tbilisi to write prayers in the Northern Kurdish language (Kurmanji language).

The alphabet is presented in Unicode in a modern form, obsolete letters are encoded separately at the end of the block.

The Yezidi script belongs to the type of consonant-vocal scripts. The letters are written from right to left. What comes to its punctuation, there is only a hyphenation sign, which is placed above the last letter in the line. There were many diacritics in the manuscripts, but the meaning of most remains unclear. That's why only two are included.

Modern texts use the European decimal digits, although [BLOCK:arabic Indo-Arabic forms] were used in the manuscripts.
