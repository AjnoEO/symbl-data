Tagbanwa is a Unicode block containing characters for writing the Tagbanwa languages.

Tagbanwa, also known as Apurahuano, is one of the writing systems of the Philippines. The Tagbanwa languages (Aborlan, Calamian, and Central), which are Austronesian languages with about 8,000 speakers in the central and northern regions of Palawan, are dying out as the younger generations of Tagbanwa are learning Cuyonon and Tagalog.
