Central India is inhabited by Gondi people, an ethnic group that speaks the Gondi language. In order to write in Gondi, Munshi Mangal Singh Masaram designed a special writing system in 1918. It hasn't gained any popularity, although it's still used in both handwriting and typography. The Gondi people prefer [block:telugu Telugu], [block:devanagari Devanagari] or Gundjala. The Russian Wikipedia says that the Gondi language is oral, so it doesn't have a written form.

The Masaram Gondi script is similar to other Indian scripts. It is an abugida written from left to right. Each consonant character has a horizontal line on the right, which indicates the sound /a/. You can add a sign of another vowel to change the syllable, or remove it to get a separate consonant. For similar purposes, the icons of virama and halanta are used.

The block also contains its own set of decimal digits. Masaram Gondi punctuation is no different from Devanagari and uses the same punctuation marks.
