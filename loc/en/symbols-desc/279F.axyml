How to create a flying arrow? The designers of Unicode solved this task easily, but rather effectively. They separated the tail of the arrow into several pieces which differ in length. As a result, we see a vague outline of the object, as if it was moving at a high speed.

A flying arrow with a triangle-shaped tip pointing right may be used to denote various directions of movement, as a symbol of high speed, changes, and transformations. If you need an icon with a less complicated design, check other [block:dingbats dingbats] like [U:21D7], [U:2924], [U:279E].
