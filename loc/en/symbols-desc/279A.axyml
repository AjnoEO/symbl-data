The easiest way to indicate the direction of movement, wind, flow in the text is use simple graphic symbols – arrows. They can also be applied for other purposes, for example, when designing diagrams, drawing attention to some important information in the text or in the image.

Heavy North East Arrow is one of such Unicode symbols. It's showing in the upper-right corner. This arrow looks rather huge, since it's made with a thick black line. Its "tail" is a bit wider in the lower part, and the tip of the arrow looks like a triangle with black filling. There are more similar arrows on Unicode - [U:21D7], [U:2924].
