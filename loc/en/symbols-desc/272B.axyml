A dingbat in the form of a five-pointed star with a round circle in the centre. The rays of the symbol are filled with black, but the central part is left transparent. This unusual asterisk is often applied as an embellishment to bullet lists, important paragraphs, titles, nicknames and textual ornaments. It looks contrasting, but succinct. Thanks to its neutral meaning, it can be used in any context imaginable.

Apart from the Open Centre Black Star, Unicode has other five-pointed stars, including black star [U:2605], shadowed white star [U:2730], and pinwheel star [U:272F].
