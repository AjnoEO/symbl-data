The set of integers ℤ = {…, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} consists of the natural numbers (positive integers), their negative counterparts, and zero. The term "integer" comes from the German word "Zahl," meaning "number." The set ℤ is countable (equivalent in cardinality to the set of natural numbers ℕ).

The sets [U:2115], [U:2124], [U:211A], [U:211D], [U:2102] are often written in bold font (for example, in the works of Nicolas Bourbaki) or as double-struck letters on blackboards and manuscripts. American mathematicians introduced the usage of double-struck font in printed texts, and it became popularized with the famous textbook on complex analysis by Gunning and Rossi, published in 1965.
