Angle bracket is a symbol which is clearly familiar to mathematicians, physicists, and linguists. You won't find such brackets in literary texts or everyday correspondence, but you can easily meet them in textbooks and scientific papers. Such icons are used to denote graphemes (letters or hieroglyphs), lacunae, quantum states, scalar product, averaging, and other scientific phenomena and quantities.

Angle brackets differ from the inequality signs [U:003C] and [U:003E]. They have a more "expanded" configuration – a larger opening angle.

In Unicode, the Right-Pointing Middle Bracket is usually used as a closing one. It comes together with a similar left-pointing bracket – [U:276C].
