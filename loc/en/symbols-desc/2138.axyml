Dalet or daleth is a letter represented in the Hebrew alphabet. In modern Yiddish phonetics, it represents the sound [ [d]], and also has a numerical value of 4. The dalet symbol originates from a pictogram that schematically depicts a door. An ancient letter, resembling an open entrance, can be seen in the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet.

The dalet symbol is used to write words in Yiddish, Hebrew, Ladino, and other Jewish languages. As an abbreviation, this symbol can denote King David (his name is written as ‏דוד). The Unicode standard includes dalet with a simpler rendering [U:05D3] and a wide dalet [U:FB22].
