The symbol represents a bright and elegant flower with eight petals. The camomile is painted in the black-and-white palette, just like other Unicode symbols from the early versions. At the centre of the icon there is a big white middle of a round shape. There are eight similar petals departing from it, each of the black colour, featured with a double outline. 

Flower U+2741 can be used for decorating posts, and it works well in combination with other floral symbols. Pay attention to the white florette [U:2740] and its so-called black sibling with five petals [U:273F].
