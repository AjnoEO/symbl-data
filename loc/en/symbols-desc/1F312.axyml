The moon makes a full revolution around the Earth for 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. If the Moon is somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, it is almost invisible — it is the new moon. As it moves further, it begins to "grow" — every day more of it becomes visible. This Emoji shows the beginning of this path, that is a waxing crescent.

Symbol will be useful for compilation of the lunar calendar.
