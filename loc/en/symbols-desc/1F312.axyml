The Moon makes a full circle around the Earth in 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. If the Moon is somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, it is almost invisible — it is the new moon. As it moves further, it begins to "grow" — every day it becomes more visible. This Emoji shows the beginning of this cycle, it's called a waxing crescent moon.

This symbol comes in handy for lunar calendars.
