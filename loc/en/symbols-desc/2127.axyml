Inverted Ohm Sign is commonly used to denote electrical conductivity. The logic behind this symbol is simple: since we measure resistance in Ohms, the inverse quantity (conductivity) will receive the opposite name - "Mho" and an inverted symbol.

Despite its simplicity, this naming convention has not been adopted worldwide. In the SI system, electrical conductivity is denoted by the uppercase Latin letter "S". It is, of course, also included in Unicode: [U:0053]. Use both options in your calculations and scientific work.
