To those who are not into mathematics, physics or quantum mechanics, angle brackets are unlikely to ring any bells. These symbols are more often used to denote matrix elements, averaging, and other quantities and phenomena. There's little chance of coming across them in fictional or publicistic books.

The Right Angle Bracket differs significantly from the mathematical sign "more" [U:003E] in terms of the width of the line and the size of the opening angle. It tends to be paired up with the similar left icon [U:2770], which is called "an opening bracket".
