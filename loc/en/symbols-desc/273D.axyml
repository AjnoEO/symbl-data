This icon represents a heavy star with drop-like rays. The six-pointed symbol resembles a schematically drawn snowflake or flower or maybe a typographic asterisk for footnotes and comments. This dingbat is often used to decorate stationery, books, magazines, brochures. You may come across it in virtual texts - on web pages, in nicknames, set ornaments and frames.

Such a teardrop-spoked asterisk is available for combining with other bold and heavy icons. For example, with a chevron snowflake [U:2746] or a spark [U:2748].
