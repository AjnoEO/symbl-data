If somebody asks you to draw a flower, what will your picture be like? Probably it will look similar to this U+2740 symbol - a basic "camomile" with five petals and a noticeable round centre. We are all familiar with such a flower. It's associated with joy, summer, nature, childhood and other positive things. 

The designers made sure that each petal of the flower U+2740 had a small line departing from the centre. Thanks to the detailed picture, the flower seems three-dimensional. Unicode has more flowers like this, for example, a variation with black petals [U:273F].
