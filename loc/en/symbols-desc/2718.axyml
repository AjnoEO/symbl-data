Heavy cross U+2718 is used in official papers and documents to mark the right answer. It's also put in voting ballots and bullet lists to express the preferable option or finished activities.

Unlike multiplication signs, this symbol is formed by two uneven crossed lines. It looks as if it was written by hand with a bold black highlighter or crayon. In order to make the symbol more natural, its borders were drawn roughly. 

If you're looking for an analogue of this symbol to use in voting questionnaires, check this one [U:2717]. It has a similar image, but a thinner texture.
