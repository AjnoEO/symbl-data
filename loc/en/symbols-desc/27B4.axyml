Is this Cupid's arrow or a tool for punishment and retribution? Or maybe a symbol of determination and overcoming any obstacles? It's up to you to decide, because an icon with a universal design may have any metaphorical definition. And it is also suitable for indicating the direction of wind, current, movement – to the southeast or down to the right. Use it to bring more creativity to your posts on social media or decorate a nickname.

The shaded pen arrow pointing to the southeast belongs to the category of dingbats created by the famous font designer Herman Zapf. It has all the attributes of a real sports or combat arrow – a tip, a shaft, a tail with a plumage. Other symbols similar to this arrow include the following - [U:27B3], [U:27B8], [U:27BA].
