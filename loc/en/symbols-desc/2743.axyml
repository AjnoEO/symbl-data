Symbol U+2743 has six drop-like rays with a heavy outline. One half of each is filled with black, the other is left transparent. Due to such a manner of drawing, the star seems to be turning around.

Although symbol U+2743 is called an asterisk, its shape reminds of a flower. Unicode has more icons with similar drop-shaped rays. For example, a heavy teardrop-spoked asterisk [U:273D] and a shape featuring a circle in the centre [U:273B].
