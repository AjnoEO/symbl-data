Curly brackets are used less often than round or square ones. Most often they can be seen in mathematical formulas and exercises, as well as in program code. Curly brackets are often applied to combine items into groups within tables and diagrams. 

Medium Right Curly Unicode Bracket is similar in shape to the classic curly one, but differs in line thickness. This closing sign is often combined with the opening symbol [U:2774]. Such a symbol will fit perfectly in a bold text.
