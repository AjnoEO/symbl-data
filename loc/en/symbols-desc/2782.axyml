It's hard to believe that "three" used to be depicted as a palm with three fingers raised! Today the appearance of this numeral has changed significantly: it has gained a vertical position and lost the long "tail", which represented the palm. 

Dingbat Circled Sans-Serif Digit Three is a perfect example of a "three" designed in a minimalistic manner. This number, placed in a transparent circle, can be used in various texts and topics, since it's well-combined with the majority of popular modern fonts. Besides, it looks neutral and fits any style.

Use the digits from this series to write down the number of somebody's phone, office, or simply apply it to the important dates in your calendar: [U:2782][U:2780]. [U:2780] [U:2781]. [U:2781][U:2782].
