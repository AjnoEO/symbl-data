The End of Transmission character was designed for use in telegraph and other communication systems. It indicated the end of data or message delivery between devices.

The use of the U+0004 character has become less popular in modern computer systems and applications. Its functions are often replaced by other methods of encoding and structuring data, such as data transmission protocols and checksums.

Like other control characters, this symbol has no visual representation and does not occupy a lot of space on screen or in typed text. There is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphical depiction of the End of Text symbol. It shows as the EOT (End of Transmission) abbreviation - [U:2404].
