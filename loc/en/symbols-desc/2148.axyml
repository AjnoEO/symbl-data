The modern Latin letter "i" comes from the Greek iota and the Phoenician symbol "yod." It is used in many languages to represent vowel sounds similar to [ [i:]] depending on its position in a word.

Lowercase "i" is used to denote the imaginary unit in mathematics and as an index variable in programming. It is also popular in the marketing field, since this symbol has been established as a prefix for product names of the Apple brand.

A double-struck italic lowercase letter i would be suitable for writing formulas. It can help decorate your username, headline, or post on social media. Use it together with other double-struck letters: [U:2147], [U:2146], [U:2149].
