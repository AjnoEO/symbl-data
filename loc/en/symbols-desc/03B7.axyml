This is the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet. In the Ionic number system, it is 8. It originated from the Phoenician letter Het, and Latin and Cyrillic letters originated from it, such as Н, И, Й. In the Old Slavonic alphabet, this letter corresponded to the letter "izhe". In modern Greek, it is called Ita and is pronounced not quite as it was in antiquity.

Like many other Greek letters, this one has found wide use in scientific notation. It refers to the enthalpy, refractive index, efficiency, and much more.
