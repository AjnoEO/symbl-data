A round-shaped and flat toy, which looks like a disc. Due to its specific design, it can be launched in the air with further returning to the owner's hands. It's called frisbee and it's a popular toy among both children and adults.
Platforms depict it in orange or blue colour. Some of the versions feature an air current, which indicates that the frisbee is in the process of flying.
