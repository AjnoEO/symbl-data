Every advanced civilization got a chance to create its own number writing system. The Arabic and Indian schemes turned out to be the most efficient ones. In such systems "one" was initially depicted as a simple vertical bar. Afterwards, it obtained the characteristic mark (like a "nose")  - a trail left by the ink when a person would write fast. 

Dingbat Circled Sans-Serif Digit One is a symbol of Unicode that can be used in numbered lists, or for denoting paragraphs and sections. The icon is placed in black circle with transparent background.
