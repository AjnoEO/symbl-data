Outlined Black Star is a symbol with code U+272D. The icon is fulfilled in the black-and-white palette, just like all dingbats from the first version of Unicode. It differs from the simpler black star [U:2605] as it has an additional layer of the dark outline. This layer is placed a bit further than the star itself. Thanks to this way of drawing, the symbol looks three-dimensional and illuminated.

Outlined Black Star is used in typography, on websites and messengers. It serves for drawing attention to nicknames and headlines. Apart from that, it marks points in bullet lists and emphasizes the important information.
