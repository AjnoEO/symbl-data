The Start of Text (STX) symbol was developed for use in telegraph and other communication systems to indicate the beginning of the text part of a message following a header that begins with the character sequence [U:0001] [U:0001 *#].

In modern computer systems and applications, the use of the U+0002 character has become less common as its functions are often replaced by other methods of encoding and structuring data.

Like other control symbols, this one has no visual representation and does not occupy a lot of space on screen or in printed text. There is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphic image of the Start of Text character as the STX (Start of Text) abbreviation - [U:2402].
