The four-pointed star U+2723 differs from other similar symbols by its unusual shape. It consists of lines of equal length, at the ends of which there are small teardrop-shaped balls. The intersection of the thin lines is crowned by the right circle.

The Four Balloon-Spoked Asterisk symbol looks like an equilateral Greek cross, an element of the ancient floral ornament, and an unusual asterisk at the same time. You can use the icon in different ways, including title decoration, nickname embellishment, or column separation/frame composition.
