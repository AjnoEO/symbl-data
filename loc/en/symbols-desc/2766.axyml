A flower-shaped heart is one of the classic typographical symbols for text decoration. It appeared long before the creation of Unicode ans was used by printmakers in complex frames and set ornaments of all kinds. As for printing, such hearts could be implemented for breaking up some parts of the books. The traditional name of this symbol is [b]fleuron[/b] or [i]printer's flower[/i]. Fleuron is considered to resemble a heart or an ivy leaf. It actually stands as an independent symbol in some popular fonts. 

Unicode features three floral hearts, including the rotated [U: 2767] and reflected [U:2619] designs. All of them are made with a heavy black line, with the outline filled black.
