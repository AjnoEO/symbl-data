How do we draw attention to a phone number or a company address, outline the number of a chair in the cinema or a bed in a train car? One way is to use an extraordinary font, for example, where digits are encircled. Such an icon won't get lost in a dull text or among boring images, so it will be easier for the reader to remember it.

Negative Circled Digit Two is one of the Unicode symbols that can help in making your post or note more visible. It depicts a white Arabic Two on the black background. The symbol doesn't have any excessive details, so it will be appropriate for any text typed in a classic font. You can combine Two with other symbols from this version, including One [U:2776] and Three [U:2778].
