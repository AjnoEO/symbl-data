Unlike the classic arrow with a tail, the tip looks bigger and more contrasting in the text, especially if it has a black fill. It can be used not only to show directions, but to make set ornaments, bullet lists, headlines, nicknames, schemes.

A filled right-pointing arrow tip is a classic example of an index icon. Unicode has other similar symbols, which look even more three-dimensional, like [U:27A2], [U:27A3].
