Arrows of a complex shape are utilized to show the trajectory of movement. They help in demonstrating that the point of destination is located right "around the corner". To get there, go straight and to the right. Such icons are pretty clear without any additional explanations. 

A bold shaded curved arrow pointing up and to the right is suitable for creating simple diagrams in the text. It invites the reader to turn the page, return to the finished paragraph once again, and remember the information from the highlighted paragraph or fragment. Use this arrow together with a similar Unicode icon [U:27A5].
