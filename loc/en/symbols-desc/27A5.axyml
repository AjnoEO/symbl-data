Arrows are used everywhere to note various directions (go to the left, go to the right, etc.). They help not only to talk about parts of the world, but also to show the trajectory of movement. Other things include demonstrating that a visitor must go straight and then turn right. Such occasions ask for curved arrows with tails, more complicated than the usual ones, like [U:27A6].

A bold shaded curved arrow pointing down and to the right can be used to navigate the text. This icon seems to tell the reader: "turn the page", "you will find the necessary information, an example, an explanation further", "pay attention to this point", "here is the consequence of the above".
