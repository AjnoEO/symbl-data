This icon comes in handy when you need to draw the reader's attention to a paragraph's number, to a position in a numbered list, or a section with address and telephone. The symbol has a neutral design, but thanks to the contrasting colour combination, it does stand out from all other digital symbols. 

Negative Circled Digit Three belongs to the category of dingbats - symbols necessary for text decoration. Such an embellishment, when combined with other similar digits from the set, can replace the classic numbers without black background wherever the author wishes, be it a creative, a post, a text. Three can be used with Two [U:2777], Four [U:2779] and other Arabic digits.
