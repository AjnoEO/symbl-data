Manat is the national currency of Azerbaijan; The currency code is USO 4217 AZN (formerly AZM). It consists of 100 gepiks. In addition, during the USSR, the Soviet ruble in the Azerbaijani, Turkmen, and Georgian languages was called "manat". According to the main version, the word "manat" comes from the Russian word "coin".

The symbol of manat is formed on the basis of the Latin letter "m" (the first letter in the name). As in many currency symbols, a technique with a stroke that crosses the symbol is used. The symbol of manat bears only a passing resemblance to the euro placed on its side. It originally appeared in 2006 on a 100-manat banknote. The author of the symbol is Austrian designer Robert Kalina.
