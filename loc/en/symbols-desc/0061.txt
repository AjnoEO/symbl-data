Latin Small Letter A a. Such lowercase Latin letters appeared in the Middle Ages from the so-called "minuscule script", which was used to save expensive parchment.

In Cyrillic script, people used to save up space between letters in a different way. They would write letters above other letters and pick cheaper materials (such as birch bark). That's why letters in minuscule were not widely spread. As for people from other cultures, it's necessary to mention that Bulgarians and Serbs borrowed some typographic traditions from the West, and their script is closer to the Latin script.
