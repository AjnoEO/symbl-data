This symbol is commonly used to denote the apothecary ounce, It’s a unit of weight that was used in the preparation and sale of medicinal products. The problem is that in different countries and even cities, the apothecary ounce varied and denoted different masses – from 25 to 35 grams. Therefore, it gradually became irrelevant.

The Unicode ounce symbol can be used in historical research, scientific papers on the development of pharmacy, and other texts. It seems that the original meaning of this symbol has kicked the bucket, so nothing bad will happen if you simply decorate your social media post or nickname with this little hook.
