How to denote the direction of movement, stream, wind in a text or a graphic message? Obviously, a simple arrow may help. This classic icon of a straight "tail" with a tip appeared not so long ago. It's been used since the XVIII century. Before that various directions were noted with drawings of traces or pointing fingers.

A bold arrow with rounded ends pointing to the right is one of the classic examples of an index character from Unicode. Unlike other similar icons, it has no sharp corners. Use the arrow with rounded elements in your text or choose a similar character: [U:21A6], [U:21FE], [U:21D2].
