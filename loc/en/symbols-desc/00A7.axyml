A paragraph is a complete piece of text. They are usually singled out in the official literature, such as textbooks, legislation, financial documents. Then they are numbered to simplify the orientation of the content.

The icon of section sign is two fused Latin letters S. But it is in our tradition, and some other people it looks quite different, and is not placed at the beginning and at the end of the text. Here are some examples:

။ - Myanmar

፠ - Ethiopic

᨟ - Buginese

܀ - Syriac section symbol
