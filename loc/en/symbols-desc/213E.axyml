The uppercase gamma is used as a symbol for phase space, energy level width, adsorption capacity, and other physical and mathematical phenomena. This letter is part of the modern Greek alphabet and it represents sounds [ [ɣ]] or [ [ʝ]] depending on the phonemes beside.

There are several Unicode characters for denoting the capital gamma: classical [U:0393] without serifs, Coptic [U:2C84], bold italic [U:1D792], as well as the double-struck capital letter that you can copy from this page. Use these symbols in your scientific papers, essays, and other written sources. Another great idea is to decorate your social media post with this symbol.
