A fallen leaf illustrates the abscission. When the temperature decreases, the water in the ground freezes and the plants can not absorb it. And the leaves at the same time continue to evaporate moisture. In order not to dry up, the trees shed their leaves. This Emoji is well suited to portray autumn or herbarium.
