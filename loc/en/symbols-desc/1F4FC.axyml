A videocassette which had been popular before DVD was introduced. People used videotapes for recording television shows or movies, so that it was possible to play them later. Platforms display it in its classic black colour with two white reels, rectangular-shaped. 
This emoji is useful in discussions about movies, videos, and filming, plus it used to be an icon for playing or recording videos.
