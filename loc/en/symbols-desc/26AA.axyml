A medium white circle, absolutely transparent. It serves a good framework for male and female symbols. The absence of an arrow or a cross suggests asexuality or genderless nature. This emoji can also play the role of a wedding ring expressing engagement or betrothal.
In other cases people may refer to this emoji as just a sample of white or grey colour when talking about art, drawing, graphics, etc.
