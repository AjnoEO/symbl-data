Designers assure that writing long texts with curly letters and other embellishments is not worth the effort. Otherwise, it will be hard for the reader to perceive the information. However, highlighting a couple words with unusual symbols seems rather appropriate. 

"Script Capital I" from Unicode can be used in logos, nicknames, and headlines, on business cards and wedding invitations, and even in commercial or advertising leaflets. This symbol looks elegant and graceful on its own, and it’s easily combined with other fonts too. Your text may look like this: [U:2110][U:0064][U:0065][U:0061].
