Imagine that you’re in Spain. It’s really hot, and you want to buy some exotic fruits. You come up to a grocery tent and check the price tags. There’s a strange sign of them: letters "c" and "u" divided by a slash. How much do you have to pay for the refreshing citrus? Let us explain: "c/u" on the price tag means “for one piece”. It comes from the Spanish “Cada Una”, which basically means "each" or "every". 

Just in case, if you ever need to print Spanish checks or price tags, don’t hesitate to use symbol "C/U" from Unicode. This fraction symbol is included in [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols]. It’s suitable for any text, mockup or creative.
