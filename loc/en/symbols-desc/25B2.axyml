This symbol is often encountered in geometry, symbolism, design, art, geographic and weather map legends, and textual graphics.

The triangle is one of the basic geometric shapes with three angles. This explains its popularity in design. For example, it may represent a button on the gamepads of Sony Playstation consoles. Besides, you may see such triangles on geographic maps, where they are used to indicate hail precipitation, oil deposits, and iron ore locations.

In addition, maybe you knew that a black triangle with the vertex pointing upward is depicted on the flag of Saint Lucia.

In texts, this symbol can replace the Greek letter "Delta" [U:0394] or the letter A [U:0041 Latin]/[U:0410 Cyrillic], though less frequently than the white upward-pointing triangle [U:25B3]. This symbol is also placed at the beginning and/or end of a username, chapter title, or section on a web page.

The black triangle can be used as a marker to highlight specific text, including hyperlinks. A prominent example is several black triangles placed below the words "Subscribe" or "Download" as a call to action.
