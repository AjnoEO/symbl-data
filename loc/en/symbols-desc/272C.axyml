Symbol U+272C is a star with a bold outline and a black circle in the central part. The icon with five equal rays resembles a schematically depicted flower, so it can be used as part of a floral ornament.

This contrasting appealing symbol can often be seen as a typographic decoration of headlines, lists, highlighted paragraphs, nicknames on social media and forums. If you need a simpler five-pointed asterisk, you can use black star [U:2605] or shadowed white star [U:2730].
