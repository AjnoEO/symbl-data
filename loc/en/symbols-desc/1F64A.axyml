This monkey is called "speak-no-evil", because it belongs to the Three Wise Monkeys that stand for the proverb "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil". The proverb basically means: "If i don't react to something evil, it will not touch me."
It can also imply "Omg I've just said nonsense!" The monkey is pictured with an amused face expression pressing its paws against the mouth, as if having said something inappropriate.
