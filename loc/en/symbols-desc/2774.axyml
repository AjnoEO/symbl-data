Curly brackets are familiar to everyone who has studied at school. They are used in math lessons as a system of inequalities and equations, or to denote sets, to describe vectors. Apart from that, curly brackets are used in programming. Less often they can be seen in ordinary texts, for example, combining several elements in tables and diagrams.
 
Medium Left Curly Bracket from Unicode poses almost no difference from the original Left Curly Bracket [U:007B]. It features a bolder line, but displays the same shape as the classic icon. The left bracket is used in combination with the right [U:2775].
