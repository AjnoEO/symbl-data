The symbol named "Property line" is a ligature of the Latin letters P and L. The symbol can be used instead of the abbreviation or acronym PL, which can stand for various phrases such as private line, plural, power law, programming language, etc.

Ligatures used to be symbols that saved space on expensive paper and speeded up the work of book scribes. Today they serve as original decorations in any text and draw the attention of readers. Unicode includes several two-letter characters, such as [U:00E6], [U:0152], [U:04B4].
