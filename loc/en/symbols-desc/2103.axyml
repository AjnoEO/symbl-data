Celsius degree is a unit of temperature measurement. It was named after the Swedish scientist Anders Celsius, who invented and proposed this scale in 1742. The letter "C" in the degree symbol is the first letter of the surname Celsius written in Latin (Celsius). Nowadays, this scale is the most popular in the world. The only places where it's not used are the United States and neighboring territories, where Fahrenheit degrees are preferred.

Zero degrees Celsius is the temperature at which water freezes. One hundred degrees Celsius is the temperature at which water boils, under normal atmospheric pressure. One degree Celsius is equal to one Kelvin.
