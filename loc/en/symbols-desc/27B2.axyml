Why are there more than 600 arrows in Unicode? Some of them are necessary for writing mathematical formulas, examples, chemical reactions: [U:2192], [U:21C1]. As for others, you can take them and decorate your text. By the way, Circled Heavy White Rightwards Arrow falls right in the latter category.

This icon looks extraordinary compared to simple index signs. The arrow is depicted against the background of a circle with a dark fill, and its tail seems to be infinite – it does not have a full outline. The symbol will look good in bullet lists, headings, notes, creatives and posts for social media.
