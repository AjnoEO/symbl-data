This icon is a [https://unicode-table.com/en/0043/ Latin letter "C"] in the circle. Correctly to call it - a sign of copyright law protection. Applied with published work of the person or of the organization. Sometimes it indicates, in fact, protected content. It is like a notification "Caution, [https://unicode-table.com/en/1F608/ evil] copywriter." The absence of a copyright sign does not mean that rights does not belong to anyone. For the rights to the work appear with the author, when he creates it. Theoretically, for this, some formality of the registration type is not needed.

The first letter of the word copyright is the basis of the symbol. In places that do not pretend to be solid, it is sometimes written like this: (c).

By analogy with the symbol of copyright there is also a sign of copyleft. It looks almost the same, only the letter "c" is expanded [U:0254]. Indicates the reverse, i.e. rightholders allow the distribution of the object and its versions, usually provided that all derivatives are also free for copying.
