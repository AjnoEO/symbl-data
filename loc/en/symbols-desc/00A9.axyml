The [b]copyright sign[/b] is printed on the keyboard with Alt + 0169. The numbers are typed on a numeric keypad with Num Lock on.

This icon is a [https://unicode-table.com/en/0043/ Latin letter "C"] in the circle. To call it correctly - a sign of copyright law protection. Applied with published work of the person or of the organization. Sometimes it indicates, in fact, protected content. It is like a notification "Caution, [https://unicode-table.com/en/1F608/ angry] copywriter." If there's no copyright symbol, it doesn't mean that the rights belong to nobody. For they automatically appear as soon as the author starts creating something. In theory you don't need to registrate them or anything like that.

The first letter of the word copyright is the basis of the symbol. If the text you see doesn't aspire to be solid, you may find this sign: (c).

Together with copyright there is also a sign of copyleft. It looks almost the same, only the letter "c" is facing the opposite direction [U:0254]. It indicates the reverse, i.e. rightholders allow the distribution of the material and its versions, usually provided that all derivatives are also free for copying.
