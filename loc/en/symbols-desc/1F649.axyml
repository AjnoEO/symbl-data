This monkey is called "hear-no-evil", because it belongs to the Three Wise Monkeys that stand for the proverb "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil". The proverb basically means: "If i don't react to something evil, it will not touch me."
It may also mean "I can't believe my ears!" The monkey is depicted laughing and pressing its paws against the ears. Also this emoji may express overall confusion.
