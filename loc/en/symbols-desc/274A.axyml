We are presented with an eight-pointed asterisk with drop-shaped rays and a round centre. The drawing is carried out with black lines. Visually it resembles a flower, a sun or a propeller. Thanks to such descign, this symbol is not attributed any specific meaning, so you can use it as a decoration in various elements of posts and texts.

Unicode has more other eight-pointed dingbats. For example, a classic star with pointed black rays [U:1F7CE] and a thin succinct snowflake [U:1F7BB].
