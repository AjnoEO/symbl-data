Symbol U+2711 is often used to decorate office supplies - wordpads, forms, diaries, journals, notebooks. It's placed next to the section for making notes or writing comments. As for books and magazines, the sign with a white nib may be applied in reference to the author's footnotes, comments, important paragraphs, which the reader should pay attention to.

As many other classic dingbats from Unicode first versions, this transparent white nib is drawn schematically. The sign has a strict black outline and a filled tip of the nib (that's where the ink builds up).
