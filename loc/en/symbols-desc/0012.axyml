The Device Control Two symbol was used mostly in computer terminals, printers, word processing systems, and telecommunication equipment in order to control functions of various devices.

It is one of the four device control characters: [U:0011] DC1, [U:0012] DC2, [U:0013] DC3, [U:0014] DC4. They all provided the ability to transmit special instructions for controlling device functions and modes of operation. The assignment and interpretation of device control symbols depended on the specific device and communication protocol.

As for modern computer systems and applications, the U+0012 symbol is rarely used there, since other mechanisms and protocols are employed to control device settings and functions.

Like other control symbols, this one has no visible representation and doesn't occupy a lot of space on screen or in typed text. However, there is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphical image of Device Control Two as the abbreviation DC2 â€” [U:2412].
