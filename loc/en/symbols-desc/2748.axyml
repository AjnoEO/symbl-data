Dingbat U+2748 is called a sparkle, but it rather resembles a flower with four petals and straight little rays. The drawing consists of black lines, it doesn't have shadows, a contrasting outline or other details. The centre features a small accurate circle with a filled background.

Symbol U+2748 is used as a typographic decoration: it comes in handy when it's necessary to create bullet-lists, highlight important headlines, draw attention to a meaningful paragraph. The icon is well-combined with other floral symbols from the early versions of Unicode, including the multi-coloured flower [U:2740].
