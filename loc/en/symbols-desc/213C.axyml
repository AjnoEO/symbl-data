The lowercase letter "pi" is popular in mathematics and the natural sciences. It is commonly used to denote one of the fundamental constants (3.14), matrices, osmotic pressure, parallax, etc. It is also employed to write about inflation and profit in economics.

Imagine that you have multiple phenomena or quantities denoted by the lowercase letter pi in one document. What can you do in this situation? Well, if it's necessary to mention both, use characters with different formatting! For example, add the classic lowercase [U:03C0] with a twice-drawn lowercase [U:213C], bold italic [U:1D70B], sans-serif [U:1D7B9], and other variations from the Unicode set.
