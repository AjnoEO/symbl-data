An arrow with a triangular tip and straight "tail" began to be used in various documents belonging to the XVIII century. This rather young symbol at first appeared on maps, it denoted the streams of rivers. 

Today such an icon is applied not only on maps or schemes, but also in mathematical, logical, and chemical formulas and equations. Triangle-Headed Rightwards Arrow comes in handy when it's necessary to mark important elements in pictures, or to denote the wind directions, or to describe movements just in general.

If you need a symbol with a different design, you'll easily find it in Unicode: [U:279C], [U:21FE], [U:21D2].
