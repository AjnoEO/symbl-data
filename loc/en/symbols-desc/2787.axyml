Why do we draw eight as two circles? Good question with no answer. The only thing we know is that initially this Arabic numeral was drawn as a check turned upside down. It looked like this Greek symbol called Lambda: [U:039B]. Apparently, painting such an angle with a fountain pen was inconvenient, that's why people started adding some rounded parts to it. They mostly touched the upper and the lower parts, until the symbol turned into a two-balled snowman.

Eight is a part of numerous symbols in Unicode. Circled Sans-Serif Digit Eight is not an exception. This dingbat is often used to write down some important information, for example, telephone, office, seat numbers, or take notes of various important dates. Copy the number to your text, and it will look like this: [U:2785][U:2787][U:2784][U:2783].
