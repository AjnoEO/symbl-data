Arabs tended to write number seven with the use of an icon that looked like a Latin "V" or a check symbol. It derived from a particular gesture: you needed to take the fist (it denoted a five) and add two (fingers pointing upwards) to get seven. Due to the inconvenient orientation or size, the symbol changed its position with years, and now we write it as pointing to the right.

A simple seven without horizontal bars in the middle instantly draws attention to the text. It's often used as a decoration tool, especially when encircled, since this way it looks even more impressive. Seven usually serves for numbered lists, paragraphs, menu options, important dates or sums etc. Use Circled Sans-Serif Digit together with other symbols from this series: [U:2783], [U:2784], [U:2785] and so on.
