The ASCII Normal Mode (Shift In) symbol, also known as the uppercase mode, was used in computer terminals, printers, and text processing systems. Its aim was to return the default set of characters after switching to an alternative character set using the Shift Out symbol [U:000E] [U:000E *#]. This way the Shift Out and Shift In symbols worked together, allowing devices to switch between two sets of characters simultaneously.

As for modern computer systems and applications, the U+000F symbol is rarely used there. It happens so because there are other mechanisms and encodings that perform the function of switching between different sets and languages. For example, Unicode.

Like other control symbols, this one has no visible representation and doesn't occupy a lot of space on screen or in typed text. However, there is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphical image of Shift In as the abbreviation SI â€” [U:240F].
