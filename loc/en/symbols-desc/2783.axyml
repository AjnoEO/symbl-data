The "four" numeral took a long way to develop its own look. The Arabic system for a long time depicted it absolutely differently from the modern digit. It rather reminded of the Latin letter W turned vertically. It is considered that mathematicians were the ones who decided to transform this symbol. They wanted it to have four angles, but the rule "4 corners = number 4" didn't really stick, so the symbol got a small horizontal "tail". 

This is the picture of four that we see on Unicode. The Circled Sans-Serif Digit Four symbol reflects it perfectly. This symbol tends to be applied in numbered lists, paragraphs, chapters, and other types of decorations. You may come across it in social media posts, nicknames, published newspapers, magazines, and books on any topic. 

If you're searching for an icon that would draw even more attnetion, use digit 4 encircled in black – [U:2779].
