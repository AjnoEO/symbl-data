Did you know that a shadow outline can give an object volume, make it seem moving, and lead it in the right direction? Look at this arrow – it's flying to the right and away from the reader. Meanwhile, its white part has the simplest form imaginable. If the shadow is removed, the arrow will point strictly to the right.

You don't need to be a gifted artist to create the right shadow outline. However, this unpainted arrow with a shadow was invented by a genius, whose name is Herman Zapf – one of the founders of modern calligraphy and font design.

By the way, he also drew an arrow that "flies" to the right and to the reader – [U:27A9].
