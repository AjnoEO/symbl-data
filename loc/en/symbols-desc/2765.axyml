Researchers still discuss the origins of the heart symbol. It seems like nowadays the initial meaning doesn't really matter. Every continent, country, and culture perceives [b]heart[/b] the same - as a synonym of the verb "love" in its widest sense.

Unicode features about 30 various symbols and emojis with a heart. One of them is a rotated heavy black heart, used for marking positions in bullet lists. Use it according to its intended purpose - for example, instead of a full stop or a bullet mark when enumerating points. Moreover, you can add it in a complex ornament made of multiple dingbats. If what you need is a classic heart without rotation, check out the bold symbol [U:2764] or the white heart [U:2661].
