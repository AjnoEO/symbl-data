Once upon a time, a hundred years ago, there lived a man in Germany. His name was Hermann Zapf. For a long time he was fond of typography and fonts, until he turned 60 and realised that working only with text wasn't enough for him. So he started creating various glyphs, such as this heavy teardrop-like arrow. Instead of feathers it has an odd fat tail, as if it swallowed an elephant or a Mcdonald's burger. The English name "Teardrop-Shanked" suggests that this tail is actually a tear.

I have no idea why this symbol was encoded in Unicode. It looks ridiculous, doesn't it? Another sign pointing to the right, which there is plenty of. so I'm sure you'll be able to find a more beautiful one. For example, in our [https://symbl.cc/ru/collections/arrow-symbols/ arrow collection].
