The fire emoji has two possible interpretations. The first is connected with its literal meaning. So it can be used when reporting a forest fire or any other kind of arson, when actual "flame" is involved. The second meaning is figurative, and it conveys a praise: "You're on fire today!"
Most often the fire emoji is used in the second context, when describing something cool and "lit".
