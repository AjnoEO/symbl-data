"Planck Constant Over Two Pi" is used in wave quantum mechanics as a coefficient that relates the basic characteristics of particles, such as vector, momentum, frequency, energy, phase, and action. This separate quantity called the "Dirac constant" is equal to the "Planck Constant" divided by 2 [U:1D70B].

To denote this quantity, Unicode has a special symbol. It looks like an italicized Latin letter "h". Use the symbol "Planck Constant Over Two Pi" in your scientific works, formulas, and calculations. You can find even more special symbols in the blocks [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols] and [BLOCK:mathematical-operators].
