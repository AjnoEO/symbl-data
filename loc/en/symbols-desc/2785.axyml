Number six in the Arabic numeral system was drawn as a fist with the thumb withdrawn (the familiar "like" gesture, only in an inclined position). This image has its own logic: to get six, you need to add one to the five (it is symbolized by the palm) – a finger pointing towards yourself. When Arabic numerals began to be used in Europe, the icon was slightly modified – the "tail" was turned into a familiar "loop".

Now six can be seen everywhere, including Unicode. One of such symbols is called Dingbat Circled Sans-Serif Digit Six. Use it in combination with other digits from the series: [U:2783], [U:2784], [U:2786] and so on.
