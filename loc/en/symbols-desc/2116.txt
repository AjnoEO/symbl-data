The number sign has the shape of a regular letter "N" with a small circle in the upper right corner. It represents the number of an object, such as a document number, order number, or page number. It is commonly used in text documents, tables, and similar contexts. 

Symbol "№" came to Russian typography from the French language and appeared as a replacement for the abbreviation "number of the object." In modern French, they use "Nᵒ" without a special symbol.
