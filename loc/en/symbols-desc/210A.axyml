Most English speakers prefer to write in print letters rather than cursive: it's easier, more precise, and more practical. However, beautiful calligraphic letters are still used in various text decorations. For example, in advertising creatives, titles, nicknames, or other types of text.

You don't need to learn how to write cursive in English; simply use special fonts and symbols from Unicode, such as the lowercase cursive letter "g". The [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols] block has even more letters that can be used as decorations. For example, the uppercase letter "L" - [U:2112].
