Less-Than Sign is generally employed to show that one number (expression, variable) is less than another. This mathematical operator is one of the  inequality signs. Mathematics sees inequality as a statement about the relative size of two objects (one object is smaller than or not greater than the other), or that two objects are not equal (negation of equality). 
Unicode also offers a More-Than Sign, which is located in [BLOCK:basic-latin Basic Latin] since version 1.0.0 in 1991 года.
