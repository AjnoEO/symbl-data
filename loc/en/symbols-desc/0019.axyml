The End of Medium symbol was used in computer terminals, printers, text processing systems, and telecommunication equipment. Its main purpose was to indicate the end of a physical data storage, such as a tape or disk. It signalled to receiving devices that it was necessary to process the received data and prepare for the end of the information transmission.

As for modern computer systems and applications, the U+0019 symbol is rarely used there, since other mechanisms and protocols are employed to determine the size and boundaries of data.

Like many other control symbols, this one has no visible representation and doesn't occupy a lot of space on screen or in typed text. However, there is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphical image of the End of Medium symbol. It's the abbreviation EM â€” [U:2419].
