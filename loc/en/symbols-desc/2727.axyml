This dingbat represents a four-pointed star with a black outline. The icon looks three-dimensional, as if glowing, because the dark outline does not repeat the inner unpainted part of the drawing in terms of shape.

The star is traditionally considered the symbol of mystery, infinity, harmony and mystical forces. The four-pointed icon is also believed to be a designation of the trail, goal, and great endeavours, because it seems to point to the four cardinal directions. Compare this symbol with the pinwheel star [U:1F7C7].
