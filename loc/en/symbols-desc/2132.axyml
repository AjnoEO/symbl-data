Turned Capital F Ⅎ or the so-called [i]digamma inversum[/i] was a part of Latin alphabet, but not for a long time. In the middle of the 1st century the future Roman Emperor Claudius added it to the alphabet. At the time he was a censor responsible for conducting a population census. The inverted "F" represented consonant sounds close in sound to [ [v]].

The symbol did not last long in the Latin alphabet and was soon forgotten after Claudius' death. However, this symbol is still present in Unicode. What may you need it for? Perhaps to create fun inverted inscriptions that draw the attention of your audience. Check this out: [U:0078][U:006F][U:2132].
