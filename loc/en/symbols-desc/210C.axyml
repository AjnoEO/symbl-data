Designers and calligraphy experts recommend using the Gothic-styled letters moderately: on signs, in headlines, logos, some document titles, and nicknames. You shouldn’t type a huge text consisting of dramatically-looking letters and various decorative elements. Otherwise, the reader will have to stare hard in order to get the idea of your message.

To decorate your text properly, take the Unicode symbols from the [URL /blocks/letterlike-symbols/ Letterlike Symbols] block. Use Black-Letter Capital H in your creative, social media nickname, business card, or a stylised inscription on old paper.
