Clench your fist, placing your thumb on top of the others, and turn your palm towards your face – do you see the number 5? The thumb is the "cap" of the five, and the phalanges of the other four fingers are a rounded "tail". That was the way of thinking that people followed when improving the system of Arabic numerals.

Today, the five in the usual font is included in many Unicode characters. One example is the number 5 sans serif enclosed in a circle. This icon is suitable for formatting lists, paragraphs, chapters, and table of contents items. Use it together with other numbers from this series: [U:2783], [U:2785], [U:2786], etc.
