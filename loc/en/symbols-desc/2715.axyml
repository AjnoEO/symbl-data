Symbol U+2715 in its classic version is used as a multiplication sign. Actually mathematics is not the only field where it can be applied. When you have to choose the right answer or vote for your candidate in a ballot, this symbol may function as a substitute for check. Besides, it's often written in bulleted lists to mark separate points. However, not the positive ones, but rather describing negative, unwanted, illegal things - in this case, the multiplication sign performs as a cross and means 'no' or forbids particular actions.

Multiplication sign is presented as two black lines, leaning towards each other and forming a cross. Unicode offers more symbols with a similar meaning. For example, [U:274C] red cross-like mark, [U:2716] black multiplication sign designed in bold lines.
