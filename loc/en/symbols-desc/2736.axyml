This six-pointed star U+2736 is a thoroughly filled shape with even lines. It doesn't have shadows, contrasting outline or any other elements, that's why it looks so universal and minimalistic. The dingbat is often applied in typographic ornaments as a decoration or embellishment of social media posts (for example, in headlines, nicknames, creatives, lists).

Unlike the Star of David [U:2721], symbol U+2736 is not restricted to the religious or cultural-historical context. That's why it looks appropriate in various texts on any topic.
