Round bracket is an international punctuation mark used in writing. Even if it's not applied according to the intended purpose, any person with the average level of literacy will recognize this symbol. We come across this symbol at a very young age while solving the basic math problems. Round parenthesis denotes prioritized operations in logics, and it's often used in chemical and physical formulas. In the writing discourse, parenthesis highlights linking and introductory words, plus it helps to emphasize some additional information.

The middle right bracket from Unicode is usually used in conjunction with the left – [U:2769] and is called the closing one. It is also used in numbered lists after the ordinal number.
