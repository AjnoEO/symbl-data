[b]Equals Sign[/b] represents the complete identity or equality of the values of two expressions. It is generally used in mathematics, logic, and other exact sciences. It was created in its current form in 1557, when Robert Recorde, a mathematician, implemented this sign in his work called "The Whetstone of Witte".
