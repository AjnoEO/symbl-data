This icon has all the elements of a real sports or combat arrow: a pointed tip, a shaft and a tail with feathers. By the way, the feathers at the end of the tail perform a very important function. They stabilize the arrow when it's flying and help it hit the target as accurately as possible. However, the icon is made a little more realistic and large.

An unpainted pen arrow pointing to the right is suitable for decorating text. It can indicate the direction of movement, or it can serve as a symbol of determination, masculinity, ambition, strength, and overcoming obstacles. Before using this icon, compare it with other similar Unicode characters: [U:27B4], [U:27B8], [U:27BA].
