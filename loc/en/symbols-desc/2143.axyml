What does the reversed capital letter L look like? Perhaps, it looks like a fire poker, a hockey stick, or a grasshopper's leg. Is that actually what Unicode creators were thinking when they added the sans-serif uppercase L in [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols]? We have no idea, but you can certainly use this symbol as you want. For example, make a funny text message or an ornament.

Unicode has more reversed and rotated letters to offer. Besides, here you will also find various icons, signs, digits. Take a reversed comma [U:2E41], extraordinary letter [U:1D32], rotated digit two [U:218A] and enjoy your life to the fullest. Just remember that your text or message should be readable and understandable for the receiver.
