What does the reversed capital letter L look like? Perhaps, on a fire poker, a hockey stick, or a grasshopper's leg. Is that actually what Unicode creators were thinking when they added the sans-serif uppercase L in [URL /blocks/letterlike-symbols/ letter like symbols]?

Unicode has more reversed and rotated letters to offer. Besides, here you will also find various icons, signs, digits. Take a reversed comma [U:2E41], extraordinary letter [U:1D32], rotated digit two [U:218A] and enjoy your life to the fullest. Just remember that your text or message should be readable and understandable for the receiver.
