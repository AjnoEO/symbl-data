Heavy Left-Pointing Angle Quotation Bracket forms a pair with a similar mark aiming to the right – [U:276F]. These symbols are rarely used in typography. There are only two main situations when they're applied: a missing text fragment or an editorial comments. Talking about missing sentences, a colon is put between the right and left parenthesis.

Despite the external similarity, this bracket differs from the mathematical sign "less" – [U:003C]. It is made with a wide line and has a more noticeable opening angle.
