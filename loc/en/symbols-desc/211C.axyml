There is a huge variety of calligraphic and typeface gothic fonts. Back in the days, each and every monastery or scribe had the chance to develop their own style of writing. However, not all the fonts have survived till our days, and even fewer gothic scripts are present in Unicode.

The symbol looks quite extraordinary, so it will certainly draw attention and will serve perfectly for decorating your virtual or printed message. Create a text with this unusual letter: [U:211C][U:006F][U:0061][U:0064].
