The Start of Heading symbol was used in teletype and other communication systems to indicate the beginning of a message title. A heading usually contains metadata such as sender and recipient addresses and is used to organize the transfer of information between devices.

In modern computer systems and applications, the use of the U+0001 symbol has become rare; its functions are often replaced by other methods of encoding metadata or structuring data.

Like other control characters, this symbol has no visual representation and does not occupy space on the screen or in print. The block [BLOCK:control-pictures] includes a separate symbol representing the graphic image of the header one. It's the abbreviation called SOH (Start of Heading) â€” [U:2401].
