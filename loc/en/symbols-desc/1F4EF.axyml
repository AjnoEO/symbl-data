A postal horn, depicted as a rolled copper bugle, resembling a tube with two red tassels. Sometimes people use it for indicating announcements, or something related to brass instruments, music, and music notes. 
In the 18th-19th centuries postal horns signalled the postman's arrival and served to clear out the way for him. Today they rather act as a post symbol on postal boxes in many European post services.
