Angle brackets differ from inequality symbols in terms of a larger opening angle. Such parentheses are used in mathematics, quantum mechanics, physics, linguistics and other sciences. They denote the scalar product, quantum states, averaging, graphemes. 

In some languages, for example, Japanese and Korean, angle brackets are utilized instead of the round ones, traditional for Europeans. These round brackets are called basic and operate as punctuation marks as well.

Medium Left-Pointing Angle Bracket from Unicode is used as an opening bracket paired with the similar right-directed version – [U:276D].
