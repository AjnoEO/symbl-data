This arrow resembles the previous one, the only detail that's different is the bold font. It's also a part of Hermann Zapf's 100 dingbats series. Initially it was used in typography to diversify published text.

If you look at the symbol from this page closely, you can see that the left side of it is concave - it forms an obtuse angle. On the contrary, the right side is curved â€” it's an acute angle! What does it mean for us, uptodate trend followers? Ths sign is pointing to the right! Moreover, it can be classified as an arrow. Yes, I know, it's not obvious. The arrow is so fat that it looks rather like a pig, but trust my intuition. Besides, the name suggests so too. 

By the way, note that the majority of the arrows from dingbats point in the same direction. Is there a mysterious hidden meaning to it? Think about it if you have nothing else to do (and it is so, if you got to the end of this description).
