Is it possible to insert new letters in an existing alphabet? And make the native speakers use them according to the new rules? Roman Emperor Claudius' experience shows that such an endeavor is unlikely to succeed. He introduced the reversed "F" (digamma inversum) in Latin script, wishing to replace the letters "V" and "W", which were not fully established in the mid-1st century.

However, the inverted version of the small letter "f" did not become widely used and disappeared from the alphabet immediately after Claudius' death. Nevertheless, it has been preserved as a Unicode symbol in case you need to make a Latin inscription or write a post in the language of that era.
