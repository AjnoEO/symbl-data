To denote quotation marks, you can use not only the classic typographic double angle commas [U:00AB], but also other Unicode symbols. Among them is a double comma with bold rendering. The icon will be located above the main line, it will be appropriate at the end of a quote or title. Paired with the U+275E icon, you can use U+275D - a double inverted comma [U:275D], which also has an upper location and is made with a bold line.
