This arrow looks three-dimensional and it seems to be flying to the right. The designers of Unicode have reached such an effect with the help of the black bold shadow. It's depicted above the arrow, that's why the icon is a bit leaned to the reader. Besides, this arrow has not an ordinary tail, but a split one. It's a visual reference to the feathers on real arrows used for fighting, sports, archery in general.

Take this symbol to decorate your texts - articles, headlines, creatives, announcements or posts on social media. A text that is complemented with appropriate symbols looks more attractive.
