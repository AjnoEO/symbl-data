This heavy check mark used to be a typograph glyph, and nowadays it's become an emoji. The colour depends on the platform, it can be red, blue, green or grey, but as a rule it's just black. That's what technology does to pure and decent symbols! Luckily, Unicode has one more [U:2713 check character], which hasn't been touched by emoji fever yet.

Ð¡haracter derived from set of glyphs the ITC Zapf Dingbats series 100.
