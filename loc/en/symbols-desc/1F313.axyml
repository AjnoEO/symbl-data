The Moon makes a full circle around the Earth in 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. By the moment the Moon has passed half of the way from the new moon (or eclipse), it is seen half lit. That's what this emoji demonstrates, as the right half of the disk is orange.

This symbol comes in handy for lunar calendars.
