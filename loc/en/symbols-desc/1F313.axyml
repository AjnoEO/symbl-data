The moon makes a full revolution around the Earth for 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. Halfway from the new moon (or Eclipse) the Moon is half lit. This is displayed by Emoji - the right half of the disk is orange. It's called the first quarter.

Symbol will be useful for compilation of the lunar calendar.
