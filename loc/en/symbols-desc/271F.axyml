The Latin cross U+271F is drawn with black lines and complemented with a dark frame on the outline. The outer part of the shape is placed a bit further that the inner, which creates the effect of lighting up the symbol. The icon looks three-dimensional.

The icon depicts a classic Latin cross, with its vertical part being slightly larger than the horizontal one. It is a symbol of Catholic and Protestant churches. Outlined Latin cross may be used instead of a simple typographic one. For example, to mark places of worship on a map, the date of death, as well  to embellish religious texts.
