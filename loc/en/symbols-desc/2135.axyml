The letter Aleph is present in the ancient Hebrew alphabet and Yiddish language. In modern interpretation, it represents the vowel sound [ [a]] or functions as silent. The name of the letter comes from the West Semitic word "aleph", which means ox. The original shape of this letter was similar to the head of a bull.

The Aleph symbol is used to denote the power of an infinite set and is written with a subscript. In Kabbalistic tradition, this symbol symbolizes the boundless divinity, the beginning of the creation of the world.

Unicode offers even more symbols for writing the Hebrew letter Aleph: [U:05D0], [U:FB2E].
