Heavy Right-Pointing Angle Quotation Bracket is applied together with this right sign [U:276E]. Such a pair of symbols tends to mark gapped information or a fragment missing from the text. The punctuation mark put between the right and left brackets is called [b]ellipsis[/b] [U:2026]. It means that the author has referred to some events or has quoted another book or edition.

One more way of using angle brackets is to denote writer's, editor's, or publisher's comments. For example, if an interviewee missed a word crucial for the understanding of his/her speech, the journalist or the author of the printed text may add it in brackets, thus clarifying the information.
