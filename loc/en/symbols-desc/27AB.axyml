This arrow points to the right and seems to be lying on a horizontal surface. It looks three-dimensional thanks to the black shadow that the reader clearly sees. The main part of the icon has no dark fill, and it's framed by a thin outline.

What would you need a lying arrow? You may want to demonstrate the direction of movement, wind or current (just not in a scientific article and not on an official map). Decorate the title of the article on the topic of changes, transformations and transitions. Most likely, this icon is not suitable for formulas, mathematical and logical descriptions. There are more primitive arrows for such purposes, for example, [U:2192].
