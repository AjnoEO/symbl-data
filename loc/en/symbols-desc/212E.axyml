The lowercase letter "e" is often seen on the packaging of cosmetic products labeled according to the standards of the European Union. This letter is called "Estimated Sign" or "E-mark". The symbol indicates the exact correspondence of the declared weight or volume of the product to the actual values. According to labeling rules, only grams (for solid, powdered substances) or milliliters (for liquids) can be used as units of weight and volume.

This symbol differs in appearance from regular Latin and Cyrillic letters "e". You can use it on your labels and stickers, in product cards on your website, in informational articles about symbolic designations.
