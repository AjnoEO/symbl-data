A cross not filled with colour. It consists of four bars which form a convergence at the centre. All the bars have the same length and width, that's why such a cross may be called Greek.

Open centre cross is rarely used to actually talk about religion. You are more likely to meet as a dingbat in a text - some kind of a decoration for bullet lists, titles, footnotes, quotes. Apart from that, the symbol is often applied in nicknames and other non-religious contexts.
