A symbol with Nine in a black circle is one of the numerous dingbats belonging to Unicode. It comes in handy when you need to add variety to your text or to highlight some important dates, numbers, digits, list items.

Use Negative Circled Digit Nine for writing the number of your office on a leaflet or a business card: [U:2776][U:277E]. If you have an appointment or event to attend, write down the start or end of it: [U:2776] [U:277E]: [U:277F]. Thanks to the contrasting colours, such a note won't get lost among other text information, and the reader will memorise it better.
