Ampersand is nearly one of the most popular logograms which stand for a whole word ("et" means a conjunction "and"). Initially this symbol appeared as a combination of two letters "e" and "t". It grew to change with time, resulting in the fact that today we will barely recognize the old-looking letters. 

The classic ampersand [U:0026] is used not only as a conjunction in writing, but also in computer science as a concatenation operator, to get a reference to a variable, and so on. The inverted logogram that you see on this page can be placed in text for decorative purposes. Its main function is to draw the reader's attention.
