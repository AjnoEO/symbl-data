An arrow from the family of dingbats. Hermann Zapf 100 series, in particular. It was created more than half a century ago for decorating typed texts in books. As computer technology developed, such icons moved to the information environment (right here, to Unicode). Now you can copy it and diversify your row of letters with such an index pointing to the right.

As for appearance, this symbol reminds of an arrow. Such arrows were used to shoot animals and enemies from bows till the late Middle Centuries. In modern times, such a weapon is used by Cupid. He targets the heart of a human, so that this living creature falls in love with the soulmate. Sometimes Cupid misses, and the arrow pierces other parts of the human body, causing absolutely different types of emotions.
