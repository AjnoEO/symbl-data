The End of Text symbol was originally designed for use in teletype and other communication systems. It indicated the end of the text part of a message following the header, which began with the Start of Heading symbol [U+0001]. Besides, it also noted the text content, which began with the Start of Text symbol [U+0002].

The use of the U+0003 symbol has become less popular in modern computer systems and applications. Its functions are often replaced by other methods of encoding and structuring data.

Like other control characters, this symbol has no visual representation and does not occupy much space on screen or in typed text. There is a separate symbol in [BLOCK:control-pictures] representing the graphical depiction of the End of Text symbol. It shows as the ETX (End of Text) abbreviation - [U+2403].
