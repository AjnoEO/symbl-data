Got a 10/10 score, wanna praise your interlocutor or brag about your excellent results? Write a post about it using one of the Unicode symbols - a sans-serif number 10 enclosed in a black circle. This simply designed icon looks stunning thanks to the combination of the dark fill with the white lines. Unicode offers more digits in a similar style: [U:278A], [U:2791], [U:2790] and so on.

Ten is the core part of the system of counting that people employ around the world. Symbolically, it contains all the previous digits and means completeness, fullness and universal nature of things. From a geometric point of view, a ten is synonymous to a circumcircle [U:25CB].
