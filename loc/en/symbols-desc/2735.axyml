Star U+2735 is drawn with thin black lines with partial background filling. In other words, each line is partially filled, that's why this geometric shape looks three-dimensional, as if it's moving and twirling in the air.

Eight-pointed star is one of the christian traditional symbols. It's often associated with the Bethlehem star and used as a Christmas decoration.

Unicode has more partially coloured asterisks. For example, a three pointed pinwheel star [U:1F7C3] and a simple pinwheel star [U:272F] or pentagram.
