<h2>Briefly about the history of the ruble symbol</h2>

<p>Ironically, the russian ruble symbol has a fairly long history of use. Of course, he was not the same as now and has nothing to do with the present. First time, in documents, it appeared in the XVII century. Then the numbers were recorded with the help of <a href="/en/alphabets/cyrillic/">Cyrillic letters</a>. To distinguish them from words put a special icon <a href="/en/0483/">titlo</a>. If it was a question of money, instead of the titlo they used a ligature from the letter Р turned up horizontally and the letter У. This was the ruble sign. However, in XX it was not used.</p>

<h2>Modern russian currency symbol</h2>

<p>The modern does not come from the old one. Under the Soviet Union, the <a href="/en/collections/currency-symbols/">official currency</a> did not need an icon. It was not used in the international trade. Only in 1997 central bank of Russia announced the first competition for the development. The winners were determined, prizes were awarded, but the image was not approved. Then there were a few more competitions and voting. Time passed, but the situation did not change.</p>

<p>In 2007, a group of leading design studios agreed among themselves. Without the consent of the authorities, they began to use the crossed out letter Р.</p>
<ul>
<li>In website design.</li>
<li>When creating shop windows.</li>
<li>In the figures of money (100 kopeks = 1 ₽).</li>
<li>In articles about russian financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, in December 2013, ruble image was received by the Central <a href="/en/1F3E6/">Bank</a> of Russia. After a short time the official sign was added to Unicode. It happened in 2014, version 7.0.</p>
