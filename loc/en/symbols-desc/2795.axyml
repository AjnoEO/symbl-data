Users still argue what this emoji stands for. Some claim that it's an emergency sign, usually seen on ambulance cars (then why is it black and not red?). Others relate it to mathematics and use it for adding up figures, symbols, etc. The third party reassures that it's not even a plus, it's a cross.
Apparently, all these interpretations are valid.
