Initially this symbol was intended for use in mathematical expressions, it served as a variable. However, starting from July 2023, it has acquired a new meaning. Now it is the logo of the Twitter platform.

Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino have already announced that the company is expecting a rebranding process. It will be called "X," and the main symbol, instead of the bird, will be this very letter: ùïè. You can already find the X on Twitter's main website, it's located on the favicon, homepage, and login screen.

Now, when formatting a link to the Twitter social network, there's no need to search for an icon with the logo in SVG format; it's enough to simply copy the symbol from this page.
