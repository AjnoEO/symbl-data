This is the kind of camomile we all drew when we were little - with five round petals and a huge centre. The filled flower U+273F from the early version of Unicode is done in the black-and-white palette. It has dark petals and a contrasting white centre. Simple, but smart. And bright.

Symbol U+273F can be used for decorating any typographic products, such as things for children, romantic stuff, and nature-related goods. It's well-combined with other floral signs from Unicode, for example, a white florette [U:2740].
