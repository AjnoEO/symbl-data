The asterisk U+2725 has an unusual shape. At the end of each thin line there is a black element which looks like a clover leaf or a club icon that denotes one of the card suits.

In Unicode, the symbol is called a club-shaped asterisk because of some similarity of the tips with the clubs - ancient battle maces (weapons). However, today this similarity is not obvious, so the symbol can be safely used as a typographic decoration in texts of any subject.
