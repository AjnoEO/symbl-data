Gothic calligraphy has one important feature. Its letters often consist of multiple elements, just like the letter S, which you can see on this page. Such elements tend to include a large number of serifs, scrolls, and other decorations.

You can use Gothic calligraphic letters to decorate any text. Such embellishments will give the writing a sense of unusual, strict, and serious style. This inscription might remind you of religious topics, esotericism, magic, mysticism, and history. If you are writing texts on these and other related topics, feel free to explore other Gothic symbols: [U:2111], [U:2128], [U:211C]. They will help draw attention to headings, key paragraphs, and important information.
