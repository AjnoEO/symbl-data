The Moon makes a full circle around the Earth in 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. If the Moon is somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, it is almost invisible. This phenomenon is called the new moon, and that's what this emoji depicts.
This symbol comes in handy for lunar calendars.
