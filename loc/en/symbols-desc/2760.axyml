Most often it performs as an opening quotation mark in the following contexts: citations, headlines, direct speech, ironic words or figurative locutions. In fact, you're less likely to see a double comma in rebuses, but still. If this sign stands next to the end of the word, it means that you have to subtract the last two letters to decode the hidden word.
