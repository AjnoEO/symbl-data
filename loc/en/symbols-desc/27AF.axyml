The arrow is a familiar, but not very ancient symbol. As an index icon, it began to be used only in the XVIII century. Before that, the direction used to be indicated by depicting a footprint or a hand with a raised index finger.

Unicode arrows with a thin outline and a bold black shadow were invented by Herman Zapf. It cannot be said that he proposed something innovative, but they turned out to be quite attractive. A jagged, unpainted arrow pointing to the right with a shadow falling down and to the right has a distinctive feature. Her "tail" is split like a snake's tongue.
