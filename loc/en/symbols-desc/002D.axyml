The [b]Hyphen-Minus symbol[/b] is not a punctuation character. It is typically used both as a hyphen to connect words and as a minus sign in mathematical expressions or numerical ranges. 

The word "hyphen" is derived from the Latin word "hyphen," which in turn comes from the Greek word "huphen," meaning "together". 

Unicode has several hyphen characters. The hyphen symbol [U:2010] differs in terms of width (it is bolder). The Hyphen Bullet [U:2043] looks even bigger, and it's primarily used as a bullet point or list marker.
