The [b]hyphen symbol[/b] is not a punctuation character. In Russian, it is always part of the word, so it refers to spelling. The word hyphen came from the Latin divisio - division. Unicode has several hyphen characters. The minus differs in length and height in the line (at least, however, the font should solve everything). A non-breaking hyphen symbol does not allow anyone to break a string at this point.
