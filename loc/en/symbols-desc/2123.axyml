The symbol called "Versicle" is used in Catholic liturgical books. It indicates the first part of a hymn that is sung solo at Matins or other church services. The "Versicle" symbol takes the form of a capital Latin "V" that is crossed by a diagonal line.

The second (choir) part of the hymn is referred to in liturgical texts by the "Response" symbol: [U:211F]. If you are printing hymn books for Catholic services or restoring old manuscripts, feel free to use these symbols for the graphic design.
