Paragraph sign resembles two letters S fused together. Historians believe that this symbol appeared as a short version of the Latin term [i]signum sectiōnis[/i] – [b]section sign[/b]. According to another theory, paragraph sign is a stylized S from German [i]satz[/i] – [b]paragraph[/b]. Today this symbol is traditionally applied in documents, where it designates individual sections, or in textbooks, where it highlights separate chapters and topics. In addition, we may encounter paragraph signs in legal papers. 

Paragraph sign with a curved stem differs from the classic typographic symbol [U:00A7]. It rather looks like a modified pilcrow sign [U:00B6]. You can use this symbol to designate any independent part of a text - be it a chapter, a section, or a paragraph itself.
