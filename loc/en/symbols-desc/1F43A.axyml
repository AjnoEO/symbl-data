A wolf. It's usually depicted as a cartoon-like grey wolf face with pointed ears, white cheeks, and a black nose.
Its face expression varies across platforms - may be neutral, amiable, or even a bit threatening.
Sometimes it's used for metaphorical concepts, such as solitude, loneliness or self-sufficiency.
