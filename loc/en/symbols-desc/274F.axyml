Symbol U+274F is a square with a shadow outline. A simple unpainted figure with a thin frame seems to cast a black shadow down to the right. The graphic dingbat looks laconic, but at the same time it is clearly visible on any monochrome background due to such rendering.

The square traditionally symbolizes balance, harmonious interaction, order, and the earthly element. The Unicode U+274F icon can be used in one of these meanings, as well as as a simple graphic decoration.
