This elegant arrow can't be a military weapon or a mathematical sign. It would rather pierce the heart of a lover that has already become a target for Cupido (wink). Another scenario: such arrows can symbolize overcoming obstacles. Look at its tail, it looks so extraordinary! And the curving tip? Pure impression.

Teardrop-Barbed Rightwards Arrow will serve as a perfect decoration of your nickname, headline, list, or creative for social media. It may be combined with any classic font or calligraphic letters.
