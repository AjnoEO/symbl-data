A classic eight-pointed star with a black filled background. It has no contrasting outline or shadows. The octogram is a traditional symbol of many cultures and religions. According to the Christian tradition, this is how the Star of Bethlehem is depicted, which is often used as a Christmas and New Year decoration.

Unicode offers you a lot of various eight-pointed stars. For example, formed from two squares [U:1F7D0] (it's called "very heavy"), as well as a snowflake [U:1F7BE].
