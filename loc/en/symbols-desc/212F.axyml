The lowercase letter "e" written in italic font has a lot of different meanings. It's commonly used to denote an electron, Euler's number, and elementary electric charge. If your text contains several meanings at the same time, you can use the Unicode symbol alongside the standard letter. It will help avoid confusion and guide the reader in the right direction. For example, use the symbol [U:0065] to refer to Euler's constant and [U:212F] to describe electric charge.

The lowercase calligraphic letter "e" is suitable not only for writing formulas. You can use it as a decoration for a headline, nickname, or social media post. Combine the symbol with other Unicode characters and create original inscriptions that draw attention of the audience!
