The symbol U+2707 depicts a tape drive, which used to be relevant when listening to music on the tape recorder or cassette player. The sign is done as a small circle with holes, through which you can see a black tape. The schematic drawing doesn't have excessive details or shadows, just like many other Unicode symbols from first versions. 

The icon of tape drive is most often applied to mark the buttons launching tape recorders or any other programmes, functions, actions that start audio or video recording.
