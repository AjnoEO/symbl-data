The Sans–Serif Number One enclosed in a black circle is a contrasting attractive icon for decorating texts. Using this symbol, you can write down your office number on a business card, your lucky number in a nickname or the time of the event on an invitation card. The final version of the number will look something like this: [U:278A][U:2790][U:2792].

If you believe in number symbolism, one may represent an active beginning and the single nature of all things existing on the planet. That's the significance given to one by the Pythagoreans, ancient Eastern sages, and other philosophers of different times and epochs.
