Radio is a wireless device, which was used for broadcasting and listening to music, new, and talk-shows. It used to be popular in 1920s and 1930s and later on, until television and Internet came around. The distinctive feature of this device is a long antenna which broadcast music and tv-shows. Nowadays the radio emoji is used for talking about something old-fashioned (in a positive sense) or about music and news.
