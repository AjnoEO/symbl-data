Unicode has more than 600 symbols depicting an arrow. Why do they need so many arrows, when there's just four parts of the world - we have no idea. Nevertheless, you'll certainly be able to pick an icon with appropriate design.

A thick filled arrow pointing to the right is one of the arrows designed unusually. It has a thick tail, and its tip looks sharp like a needle. Use this arrow to emphasize the important information in the text or to mark your bullet lists. Don't forget to apply this [URL /en/unicode/blocks/dingbats/ dingbat] in a set ornament.

If this icon seems inappropriate, take a look at other index symbols, like [U:279C], [U:27A9], [U:21FE], [U:21D2].
