A cross-shaped symbol formed by two uneven converging lines. Unlike such symbols as [U:2715] and [U:2716], it looks more natural, as if an 'x' or a cross written by hand.

Crosses are used in voting ballots and other documents to indicate the correct answer. A cross can also mark different points in lists. The structure is characterized by two thin black lines with no shadows, color irregularities or other details. Unicode has a similar cross for questionnaires and voting ballots - [U:2718] symbol, written in bold.
