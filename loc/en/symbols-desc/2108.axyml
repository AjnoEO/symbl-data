Scruple is an antique measurement unit, which equals 1,137 grams. Now it makes perfect sense why being "scrupulous" is a synonym of being precise and accurate. Try measuring weight and not missing each thousandth of a gram without modern electronic scales! 

To refer to Scruple in writing, a special symbol is used. It looks like a cyrillic letter "Э". Luckily, this symbol is available in Unicode as part of the [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols]. Take it to your treatise on antiquity, your historical article, or scientific dissertation.
