The appearance of the Gimel symbol is determined by its origin from the word "gamal" (camel). In its original form, the symbol resembled a camel that turned its head back.

The Gimel symbol is commonly used to denote a gram. In addition, it may be applied to talk about rest due to health reasons. By using this letter or the classic symbol [U:05D2], you can write words in Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino, and other Jewish languages in your text.
