A firework or firecracker that is lit on Chinese New Year, New Year's Eve, or Independence Day. It's depicted as a red tube with a sparking fuse.
Although some platforms feature a dynamite-like design, this emoji is supposed to be modelled according to the sample of traditional Chinese firecrackers.
