Here you will find an arrow - an archetypal symbol which you come across in many cultures. For thousands of years it was almost the only weapon of ancient tribes and nationalities. Today arrows are associated with masculinity, overcoming obstacles, and striving for the best. Another side of arrows refers to love and striking the human heart directly from the Cupid's bow.

The black pen arrow pointing to the right is a schematic, but quite understandable image. The symbol consists of a sharp triangular tip with bends, a straight shaft, and plumage. There are other similar arrows belonging to [block:dingbats dingbats], for example, [U:27В3], [U:27B8], [U:27BA].
