Previously, to indicate direction, an image of a hand or a footprint was used. Around the XVIII century, the first icons appeared on maps, similar to modern arrows – with a triangular tip and a straight line.

Today there are more than 600 characters with arrows of different shapes in Unicode. One of the options is a flattened shaded arrow pointing to the right. Unlike icons with classic proportions– [U:279C], [U:21FE], [U:21D2], this symbol has a short fat tail and a thick tip.
