Symbol U+2742 looks like a sun, as it's often depicted in children's books. Eight identical triangular rays are departing from the round central part. The white shape is enclosed in a circle with black fill, so it looks contrasting, clearly visible on the neutral background.

An eight-pointed star in a circle is a symbol that evokes positive associations. It can be used together with other icons of a similar style, for example, with a circled white star [U:272A], twelve pointed black star [U:2739] and the symbol of white sun [U:1F323].
