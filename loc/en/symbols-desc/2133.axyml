The capital letter "M" in handwriting is used to denote certain types of German postage stamps that were widely spread in Germany before the start of World War II. The symbol is used for the gold-, renten-, and reichsmark. In some cases, the abbreviated name implies the presence of two letters: [U:212B][U:2133].

The calligraphic uppercase letter M can also represent physical and mathematical quantities. For example, mass, moment of force, torque, magnetic quantum number. This symbol will be appropriate if you need to highlight some particular words in the text, decorate a business card, printed booklet, nickname, or social media post.
