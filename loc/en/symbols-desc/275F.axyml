Comma is one of the general punctuation marks in most popular languages. This symbol tends to be used to highlight appeals and clarifications, to separate homogeneous members of a sentence; all in all, to emphasize the important information. Speaking of English, we see that the rules around commas are still being figured, and sometimes it depends on the author, what ideas to highlight. 

Comma is also present in programming languages. For example, in the enumeration of array arguments.

The bold lower comma from Unicode can be used in texts written in large font, or in rebuses. Among the analogues of this symbol are the small comma [U:FE50] and the bold upper comma [U:275C].
