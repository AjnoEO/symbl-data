Squid is a marine animal that looks pretty much like an octopus, but with ten tentacles. It's generally depicted as an orange-pink sprout facing forward or left, with a slim body, tiny eyes, and two raised tentacles.
This emoji has become specially popular in 2021 in relation due to the release and worldwide success of the Korean drama "Squid Game".
