[b]Orthodox cross[/b] â€” a symbol of the Christian Orthodox Church. Its main feature and a distinctive feature of the Catholic, is the presence of additional crossbars: inclined bottom and horizontal top. According to legend, the top Board was a sign on which it was written: "Jesus Nazarene, king of the Jews" in three languages: Latin, Greek, and Aramaic. The lower, oblique line of the cross is a footrest. Its slope symbolizes the fate of two robbers crucified to the right and left of Jesus. One repented and went to heaven. The other did not and went to hell.

This Orthodox cross is also called the Russian or the cross of Saint Lazarus. It is believed that its form is most historically accurate. However, this is not the only symbol of the cross, revered in Orthodoxy. Also circulated as a six-pointed (without top rail) and seven-point (upper dash raised all the way up). In some fonts, the lower diagonal line of the Orthodox cross is tilted in the wrong direction.
