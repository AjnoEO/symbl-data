The fraction consisting of the Latin letters "a" and "c" is often used to denote an account current. Such an abbreviation may be seen in bank details, receipts and other bank documents. Instead of using the combination a/c, other phrases are commonly applied. For example, "account number", "account No" and others. 

"Account Of" classifies as a [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols] in Unicode. The first letter of the fraction is located slightly higher than the second, so the symbol will be different from a fraction written with a slash and standard letters from your keyboard.
