An Emoji Bank is usually depicted either as a bank building or as an inscription “BANK” or “BK”. It may not indicate the bank itself but, for example, show the location of the ATM.

In Japan, the combination “ВK” is associated with the slang word “bakkureru”, evasion of duty. This association is often transferred to the Emoji Bank.
