Lobster, a large crustacean. It's depicted as a red-orange omar (as cooked and served) with a long body and a tail. In addition, it has two tentacle-shaped eyes and ten legs, each having a huge pincer on the tip of it. This emoji can be used as a reference to the Friends series ("You're my lobster").
