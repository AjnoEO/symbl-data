In order to denote the direction of a stream, wind, shift, movement, you can try the ordinary arrows with tails, or more original, with unusual tips. They are not suitable for chemical and mathematical formulas, but they will look impressive in a text. Such icons are suitable for various lists, important notes, and complex ornaments.

A three–dimensional right-pointing arrowhead painted at the tip is an example of a Unicode pointing icon. It consists of two triangles, one of which has a black fill. The symbol looks voluminous, like a real spearhead or arrow. It has an analogue – an icon with a painted bottom part [U:27A2].
