If dates in history textbooks were written in bright colours instead of the dull black version, maybe schoolers would memorise everything much better. Try highlighting the important numbers in your text with Unicode symbols and enjoy the result! 

Use contrasting icons such as Circled Digit Six. The symbol has a neutral design, that's why it will look appropriate in any text typed in the classic popular fonts. You can place this symbol in a newspaper or a magazine, on an advertisement, a ticket or any other printed product. It's pretty common to use them in online announcements, messages, posts as well.
