First of all, such a square can be often seen in map legends, where it represents various features of the location, its relief and landscape. But it's not the only option. In basic drawing it is used to indicate a flat composition where all elements are on the same level.

Lastly, a square with horizontal fill is used in textual graphics on website pages and social media platforms.
