The sign denoting in a [URL /en/collections/mathematical-signs/ mathematical notation] a geometric figure is an "angle" (and it is itself). Example of use: ∠ABC = 45 °.

The angle is formed by two rays emanating from one point (the top of the corner). It is often indicated by three points, ∠ABC. Here B is a vertex, and A and C are points lying on different rays (sides of the angle). The corners are given the designation in [URL /en/collections/greek-symbols/ Greek letters], for example, ∠α.

The angle value (angular measure) can be calculated in different ways: in [URL /en/00B0/ degrees], radians, turns or grads. If both sides of the angle lie on the same line, then this angle is called unfolded and its value is 180 °.
