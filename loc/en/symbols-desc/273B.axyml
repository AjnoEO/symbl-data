Winter-themed posts and creatives definitely benefit from symbol U+273B. It can be used there as a small basic snowflake, quite ordinary in terms of shape. Combined with other asterisks, this symbol creates a picture of the night starry sky and casts the atmosphere of magic. Somebody might take this dingbat for a flower or sun in a concise design. 

The universal nature of symbol U+273B is easily explained - it's done as a six-pointed shape with drop-like equal rays and a small circle in the centre. All the elements of the icon have a black background filling.
