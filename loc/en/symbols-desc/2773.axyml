Did you know that in addition to the round, curly and angle brackets, there are also tortoise shell ones? They have an extraordinary shape featuring two kinks, and they function as a paired symbol, meaning that there is an opening (left) bracket and a closing (right) one. 

How should we use tortoise shell brackets? Actually, it's up to you. Sometimes you may come across them in complex scientific formulas and engineering calculations. Signs with a similar font are presented in the STIX font designed to convey various mathematical symbols. 

Unicode offers a pair for this thin right tortoise shell bracket - the mentioned-above left-pointing version [U:2772].
