The Latin cross differs from the Greek one by the size of its bars. Greek cross is equipotential, meaning that all its bars are equal, whereas Latin cross displays longer vertical bars. Unlike the orthodox cross, Latin is a four-pointed shape, which doesn't have an additional upper bar or a lower inclined line.

Symbol U+271E denotes a classic Latin cross. It's drawn with a thin black line with no colourful filling, and it's complemented with a schematic picture of a shadow on the right. That's why it looks three-dimensional.
