Parentheses appeared in the middle of the 16th century. It happened when an Italian mathematician and engineer ran out of the usual symbols to describe formulas, so he decided to invent a new paired sign. A century later, brackets became more common among scientists, and after a while the symbol migrated from logic and mathematics to typography.

There are multiple pairs of brackets in Unicode. Among them is the middle flattened right bracket. It is usually used as a closing one with the left opening [U:276A], thus making a pair. It can also be used in numbered lists or as part of a basic smiley face.
