One of the ways to make a number more prominent is to place it on a contrasting background. That's what the creators of Unicode did - they implemented this very icon called "Negative Circled Sans-Serif Digit Six". The white number six looks bright and impressive,  while its design remains simple, and it will look appropriate in almost any text. Use it for writing down important dates and numbers, plus you can complement it with other similar icons: [U:2790], [U:278E] and so on.

From a geometric point of view, number 6 traditionally corresponds to a six-pointed star [U:2736]. Numerologists and mystics believe that six is controlled by Venus, and it represents the sense of beauty, love, harmony, and emotions.
