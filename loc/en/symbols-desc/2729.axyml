Five-pointed star or pentagram is one of the most popular symbols in history. We can see it on the flags of different governments, where it embodies light, wisdom, free will, perfection, and sometimes a bit of mystery and magic.

Symbol U+2729 depicts a five-pointed star with a bold black outline. Due to the visual contrastive outline, the icon seems to have got a three-dimensional shape, but at the same time it still looks reserved and succinct. You can use this symbol to decorate any posts - from Christmas carols to magical stories. Yet Unicode offers other five-pointed stars, such as black star with the filled background [U:2605], shadowed white star [U:2730], and pinwheel star [U:272F].
