Due to the shadowy outline, this arrow seems to point to the right and to the reader. The design of the symbol was developed by Herman Zapf, one of the founders of modern typography and calligraphy. When you use this symbol in your text, remember that you are dealing with something meaningful. It happens so that significant and even great things are not always huge and extraordinary; sometimes it is a simple white icon with a black outline.

Zapf offered more than one version of the index icons. If an unpainted arrow with a shadow does not suit you, you can choose another option: [U:27A8], [U:27A9], [U:21FE], [U:21D2].
