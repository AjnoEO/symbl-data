Have you seen an arrow fixed on the ceiling? We haven't seen it either, and it's quite understandable – why would you need an icon over your head? But in Unicode there is an arrow that the reader looks at as if from below. The designer of [URL /en/unicode/blocks/dingbats/ dingbats] has achieved this effect thanks to a noticeable black shadow.

We don't know where you would want to use the icon with the upturned shaded uncolored arrow pointing to the right. But you can check it on our website and copy the code into your document. There are other arrows in the section with [URL /en/unicode/blocks/dingbats/ dingbats], for example, [U:279C], [U:27A9], [U:21FE], [U:21D2]. Perhaps some of them will suit you better.
