Gothic fonts became widely spread in the Middle Ages. Today it’s hard to imagine that large volumes of religious treatises were handwritten in letters with massive strokes and elegant details.

Fortunately, we don’t have to practice calligraphy handwriting, it’s enough to use the ready-made beautiful symbols from Unicode. For example, Black-Letter Capital L comes in handy if you need to decorate business cards, wedding invitations, leaflets, menus, and other printed materials. Copy and combine it with other letters, thus creating an accurate and stylish text. The final result might look like this: [U:2111][U:006F][U:0076][U:0065].
