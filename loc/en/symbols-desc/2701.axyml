A popular icon which is often used for denoting the line of cutting. This symbol schematically depicts a pair of office scissors with a handle of a modern ergonomic shape. They also possess slightly curved blades. The tool is presented in the black colour with its frame painted black. It doesn't have any particular drawings of various details or shadows.

You may come across such a sign on food packages, art materials, in documents (for example, if two samples of a bill are printed on one sheet). U+2701 is often combined with a dotted or dashed line, if the cutting line has a complex configuration or great length.
