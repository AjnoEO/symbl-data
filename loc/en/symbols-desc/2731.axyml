A bold asterisk with six straight and even rays is one of the classic typographic symbols. It is used to indicate footnotes, author's comments, difficult cases or rules (in math), notes and other elements of the text.

The asterisk U+2731 is made with bold straight lines, unlike the more delicate icon [U:2217], which is traditionally applied as a multiplication sign in math. Unicode also has a combining asterisk, which is usually placed above [U:20F0].
