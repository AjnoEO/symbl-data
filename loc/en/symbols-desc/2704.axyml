A schematic depiction of scissors with open blades and a strict frame. The icon doesn't have a filled background, so it doesn't draw much attention when placed on the surface of the polygraphic or printed items.

The symbol is associated with the popular office scissors, which have an ergonomic handle and slightly curved blades. The icon is drawn without details or shadows. It is fulfilled in a neutral design, that's why it's in demand when there comes a need to decorate or edit any kind of documents, packages, or other polygraphic materials.
