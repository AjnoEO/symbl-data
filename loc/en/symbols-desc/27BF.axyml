This symbol was designed by Hermann Zapf at the end of the 80's in the 20th century. It served as a simple ornament and was intended for decorating typed text. For example, you could come across it in the contents of some book, where it separated different paragraphs. Nowadays, in the era of technology, it's encoded in Unicode and also available as Emoji.

Double Curly Loop may illustrate:

[*]a movie or book plot with lots of twists.
[*]Trump's notorious signature (I must admit it's more sharp though)
[*]aerobatics
[*]if you try harder, you will see woman's breasts, size XL at minimum (no pun intended)

The double loop symbol is similar to an old audio cassette or a reel tape recorder. It is sometimes used in this sense. It stands for Voicemail on smartphones.
