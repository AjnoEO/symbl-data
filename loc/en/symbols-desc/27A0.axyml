This arrow looks as if it's flying at a high speed. The designers of Unicode have reached this effect by splitting the horizontal line into several elements of a different width. Meanwhile, the tip has kept its clear outline and classic shape.

A bold flying arrow with a triangle-shaped tip pointing left will come in handy if you want to talk about directions, shifts, changes, transformations. It can be used in various schemes and lists or for decorating any texts, creatives, nicknames. Unicode has a similar "moving" arrow with a less complicated tip, in terms of design - [U:279F].
