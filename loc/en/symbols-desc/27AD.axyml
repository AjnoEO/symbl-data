A gifted font designer Herman ZapfT, who is also the creator of some groups of Unicode characters, believed that symbols should make it easier to read text. Want to send the reader to the right? Instead of unnecessary words, use the appropriate icon. For example, here we have a bold, unpainted arrow pointing to the right, with its shadow falling away.

There are more than 600 characters with arrows in Unicode. Some of them are suitable for mathematical formulas and official documents [U:2192], while others can be used as decorations for text [U:27A9], [U:27B8], [U:27A8]. Choose your favourite from the hundreds of suggestions.
