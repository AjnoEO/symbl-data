This is yet another arrow belonging to dingbats. It's not filled with colour, only the outline is clear, but the contour doesn't have any restrictions from three sides. The arrow looks pretty near — designers must like it. 

Just like the majority of other arrows in this section, this arrow is pointing to the right. It's not accidental. That's how you're reading the text in front of your eyes. To prove me wrong, try to read the next line in the opposite direction (where the previous line stopped). Such a type of reading is called boustrophedon. This ancient tradition is actually water under the bridge, so you won't really succeed. Plus, the modern English language doesn't presuppose this style of writing and reading. We look at letters from left to right, like on this icon ➾ .
