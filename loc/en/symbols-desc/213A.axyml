The rotated uppercase letter Q may come in handy if you want to create an original nickname or brand name and draw attention to a post headline on social media using this unusual symbol. The symbol with the rotated Q resembles a flattened letter O with a "hook" to connect with neighboring letters or a primitive emoticon that "waves" with a raised hand. It seems that you'll have to work your imagination magic to apply this symbol with the maximum result.

In addition to Q, Unicode also includes letters with a more conventional appearance: [U:0051] from the classical Latin alphabet, wide [U:FF31], cursive mathematical [U:1D444].
