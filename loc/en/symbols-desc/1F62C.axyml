Emoji Grimacing face is a distorted face with tightly clenched teeth. Eyes may be either open or squinched.
A grimace may show discomfort, nervousness, fear, embarrassment or awkwardness. Mostly displeasure or just some strong emotion. If we are talking about slang, the interjection "Eek!" is used to express this state. In addition, this emoji fits the legendary "foot in one's mouth" expression.
The face may take the form of a grimace expressing a strong physical effort. For example, when lifting a barbell or sitting in a toilet.
In Snapchat, the grimace symbol is shown next to a contact who is sharing most of their photos with the same person as you. 
So you both claim to become best friends with that same person. A little awkward.

Example of use:
- Hey, just don't freak out. I've scratched your car a bit.
- ðŸ˜¬!
