Emoji Grimacing face is a distorted face with tightly clenched teeth. Eyes can be both open and squinch.

A grimace may show discomfort, nervousness, fear, embarrassment or awkwardness. Either displeasure or just some strong emotion. In foreign slang, the word Ð²Ð‚ÑšEek!Ð²Ð‚Ñœ is used to express this state. In addition, this Emoji fits the legendary Ð²Ð‚Ñšfoot in a monthÐ²Ð‚Ñœ.

The face may take the form of a grimace with a strong physical effort. For example, when lifting a barbell or in a toilet.

In Snapchat, the grimace symbol is shown next to a person's contact who sends the most photos to the same person as you.
So you both claim to be the best friend of the same person. Awkward somehow.

Example of use:

- Hi, don't worry. I've scratched your car a bit.

- ðŸ˜¬!
