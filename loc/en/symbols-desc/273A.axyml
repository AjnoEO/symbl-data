A shape with sixteen even rays. It resembles a snowflake, a flower, a star, or even the Sun - you can apply this symbol in any sense that's appropriate in your situation. 

As many other early Unicode symbols, the sixteen pointed asterisk has a concise and simple design. It's drawn with thin black lines that don't display any excessive elements. Despite its succinct nature, the snowflake looks three-dimensional and colourful (well, at least bright) thanks to the huge amount of rays.
