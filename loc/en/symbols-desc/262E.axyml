[b]Peace symbol[/b] was created for the British movement, which called for nuclear disarmament. By the end of the sixties, Pacifik became an international symbol of the opponents of the war.

The peace sign itself is a combination of the semaphore signals N and D - the first letters in the nuclear disarmament phrase.

Except for the pacific sign, pigeon [U:1F54A] can serve as peace symbol.
