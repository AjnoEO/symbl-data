A pager is a classic worn-on-belt device. It was supposed to warn the owner about incoming calls and messages. It was especially popular around 80-90's before mobile phones had been introduced, although some hospital staff (ambulance medics, in particular) in the USA still employ this device.
Platforms depict it as a black device with control buttons and a green screen.
