A facsimile signature is a special stamp with an image of a person's handwritten signature (such as a doctor, company leader, or chief accountant). If such a stamp is to be applied in a document, a special symbol is used. You can find it here [U:FF3B].

Be careful! Not all papers can be certified with a facsimile signature. It can be used in invitations, notifications, thank you and congratulatory letters, some contracts, and their attachments. More "serious" documents that have legal force must be certified with a handwritten signature.
