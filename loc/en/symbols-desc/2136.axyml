The letter "Bet" is present in the Hebrew alphabet and Yiddish language. It comes from the word "bayit" (house) and is a pictogram that schematically represents a house with a roof, foundation, and an open entrance. The Bet symbol is considered to have a mystical meaning, as it is the first letter of the Tanakh - the Jewish Bible.

The Bet letter is used to denote the power of a set in mathematics. In this case, a subscript is added to the symbol. The letter is also used as an abbreviation of the Hebrew word for "not". It can also be used to decorate text, draw attention to a headline, nickname, or other important information.
