The Planck Constant is one of the fundamental measurements of quantum theory. It has a precisely fixed value and it describes the relationship between the energy of a quantum and its frequency.

To denote the Planck constant, the lowercase italic Latin letter "h" is used. Unicode offers a special symbol for this physical quantity with the same name. Use the "Planck Constant" symbol from the [URL /blocks/letterlike-symbols/ Letterlike Symbols] block for writing formulas, calculations, examples, and texts on such topics as physics and mathematics.
