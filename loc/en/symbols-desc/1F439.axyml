A friendly hamster's face in a cartoon-like style. It's a small rodent that is often kept as a pet. Generally it's depicted as a brown-and-white hamster with a pink nose, pudgy cheeks and big round ears.
The hamster emoji may be used to talk about guinea pig, chinchilla and other related animals. However, it doesn't have a full-bodied analogue.
