The Moon makes a full circle around the Earth in 29.5 days. Depending on its position, it is seen differently from our planet. The full illumination strikes when the Moon is behind the Earth (relatively to the Sun), but not overlapped by it. It's called a full moon.
This symbol comes in handy for lunar calendars.
