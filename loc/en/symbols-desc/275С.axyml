Heavy single comma U+275C resembles a "nine" with its centre filled. This typographical symbol is put higher than the text. Like other symbols from the earlier versions of Unicode, it's not decorated with additional elements and it looks quite minimalistic. You can meet it in riddles and rebuses, where it denotes the number of letters in a word, hidden from the person playing the game.

Add U+275C - and you make up a closing quotation mark. However, for this purpose you might want to check the ready-made symbols: Unicode has right double quotation marks in thin [U:201D] or heavy [U:275E] variations.
