Calligraphic handwriting with elegant curls and graceful attachments is no longer relevant in the English tradition. Such letters have become the remnants of the past, and even schools don’t always teach children how to write cursive. However, calligraphic writing continues to be in high demand, as it creates a special mood and draws attention to what is expressed. 

Instead of wasting your time in English writing class, try using Unicode symbols. For example, "Script Capital H". It is suitable for titles, business cards, logos, and other types of text. You will probably need more beautiful symbols with curls, such as [U:2133], [U:2130], [U:2110].
