Unlike the Celsius scale, the Fahrenheit temperature scale is not related to changes in the state of water. It is actively used in the United States, Canada, and some other countries and is not part of the International System of Units. As for other countries, the Fahrenheit scale is mostly known thanks to Ray Bradbury's book and imported meteorological devices.

If you want to utilize or describe the Fahrenheit scale, use a special symbol from Unicode to denote temperature. The Degree Fahrenheit symbol consists of a superscript circle and a capital letter "F" and is included in [BLOCK:letterlike-symbols]. By the way, there is also a degree symbol in Unicode - [U:00B0].
