The Arabic number seven can be written in various ways, and it's possible to place it on a contrasting background if you need to draw more attention to the symbol. A sans-serif seven enclosed in a black circle is a perfect example of a bright and memorable Unicode icon that people want to use again and again. It's often applied in lists, paragraphs, menus, manuals, guides, on business cards, and in nicknames.

Did you notice that seven is considered lucky more often than other numbers? In fields such as philosophy, theology, and numerology, this number is associated with the sacred beginning and the fullness of human nature. Other interpretations include bliss and the connection between the material and spiritual essence.
