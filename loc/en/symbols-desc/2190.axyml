Typographic arrow symbols look like arrows and show a certain direction. The left arrow, respectively, points left.

This can be a traffic sign "left" or an icon showing the direction to an object (a toilet is on the left along the corridor).

On the Internet and computer technologies, the left arrow often shows "back" and "cancel".

The "backspace" key, often denoted by this character, deletes characters entered. In the browser, the left arrow (the same backspace key) returns a user to the previous page. It can also denote an item in the list before the current one (in paginators, sliders, on this site - go to a page with a symbol with a smaller code).

The Rightwards Arrow [U:2192] has the opposite meaning. Go to the next site, symbol, cancel the return to the previous page.
