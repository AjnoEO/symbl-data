Latin Small Letter C c. Such lowercase Latin letters appeared in the Middle Ages from the so-called "minuscule script", which was used to spend less money on expensive parchment.

What came to the Cyrillic script, people used to save space in a different way. They would write letters above letters and pick cheaper materials like birch bark. Minuscule letters were not widely used there, which is why, for example, Russian writing seemed to consist only of capital letters.  As for people from other cultures, it's necessary to mention that Bulgarians and Serbs borrowed some typographic traditions from the West, so their script is closer to the Latin script.
