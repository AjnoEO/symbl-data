        "Added translations for interface elements in all languages. Fixed the error regarding symbols with no display, so they no longer appear in H1 and 'title'. Introduced new descriptions for symbols 214A-2149 'en'.",
        "Fixed hover states for some collection badges and tools. Fixed the menu close button area on the mobile version of the website, so it no longer overlaps with the clicking area of the first point in the menu.",
