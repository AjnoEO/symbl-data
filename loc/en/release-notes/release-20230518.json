        "Adjusted the title templates on Emoji pages for the following languages: 'tr', 'de', 'en', 'ru', 'es', 'pt', 'pl' and made them more accurate. Now it will be easier for the users from these countries to find our website. We also fixed the title and H1 for the symbols that didn't have proper rendering.",
        "Increased the font size from 10px to 12px in some places. Now small information is easier to read.",
        "Updated the covers for the 'Password Generator', 'Character Calculator', and 'Emoji Keyboard' tools, making them more prominent and user-friendly. We also modified the mobile size of tool tiles and collections in the 'see also', so that larger text displays properly.",
        "Improved the search icon.",
        "The 'Symbol of the Day' now appears based on the current holiday.",
        "Added descriptions for the 'Letterlike symbols' block, such as 214A-214F 'en' and 2100-2123 'es'"
